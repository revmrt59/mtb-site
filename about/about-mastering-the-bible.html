<p>Mastering the Bible exists to help readers not only understand Scripture, but to learn how to listen to God through it.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>This work is shaped by a simple conviction: Scripture was not given merely for information, knowledge, or analysis. Scripture is the living Word of God given for each of us to personally hear God’s voice, transform our life into the likeness of Jesus, and lead us to Jesus Christ, the tree of life.</p>

<p><mark><strong>John 6:63</strong> <em>It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life.</em> (NKJV)<br />
<strong>John 5:39</strong> <em>You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me.</em> (NKJV)<br />
<strong>John 17:3</strong> <em>And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.</em> (NKJV)</mark></p>

<p>Mastering the Bible resists becoming merely informational or academic. It does not treat Scripture as data to be mastered, but as revelation through which the risen Christ speaks. It does not say, “Here is the information.” It says, “Come, sit, listen, let the Lord speak.”</p>

<p>Throughout this resource, explanation is intentionally paired with pastoral nourishment. After passages are explained, readers will often encounter a Shepherd’s Pause or Pastoral Reflection. These moments invite the reader to slow down, examine posture, and listen for what Christ is revealing through His Word.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>These pauses are not sermons and not academic asides. They are pastoral acts meant to keep the reader oriented toward Jesus Himself and letting Him speak into our life, not merely toward understanding about Him.</p>

<p>My prayer for Mastering the Bible is that it would be an invitation to come, sit, and listen to Christ speaking through His Word. My hope is to assure you that you are not alone in struggling to read or enjoy the whole of Scripture. My goal is to provide clear structure that helps you read with understanding, so that you may come to know the God of the Word more deeply.</p>
