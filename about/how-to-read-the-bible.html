<h1 id="how-to-read-the-bible">How to Read the Bible </h1> <p>Some people claim that they have tried to read the Bible but they can not understand it or get anything out of it.</p> <p>First you must realize, that if you are not ΓÇ£born againΓÇ¥, the Bible is impossible to understand. One must be born-again by faith in Jesus Christ in order to understand the Bible and to have it speak to them.</p> <div class="mtb-scripture-block"> <div> <p><strong>John 3:3</strong> Jesus answered and said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." NAS</p> </div> <div> <p><strong>John 6:63</strong> "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. NAS</p> </div> <div> <p><strong>1 Corinthians 2:14</strong> But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised. NAS</p> </div> </div> <p>Secondly, just like a seven year old does not read Shakespeare until they have learned to read things more easily understood, so too, new believers should begin reading the more easily understood parts of the Bible before the progress to the more difficult parts. New Believers should focus on the easily understood books of the Bible such as the Gospels and Psalms and avoid harder to understand books such as Leviticus and Revelation until you are grounded in the faith.</p> <p>Thirdly, when reading the Bible, if you donΓÇÖt understand something, keep going. The Bible is like the layers of an onion. Every time you read, you will peel off another layer and go deeper in your understanding.</p> <p>Fourthly and most importantly, before reading the Bible, pray and ask the Holy Spirit to open your eyes and feed your soul.</p> <h2 id="how-to-read-the-bible-1">How to Read the Bible<br /> </h2> <ol type="1"> <li><p>Set a specific time <strong><u>daily</u></strong> to read your Bible.</p></li> <li><p>Try and read 10 ΓÇô 20 minutes a day.

The Bible is clear, God only has one meaning to each passage or verse in the Bible.</p> <div class="mtb-scripture-block"> <div> <p><strong>2 Peter 1:20</strong> But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation NAS</p> </div> </div> <p>There are four main errors people make in reading and interpreting the Bible:</p> <p>First, they fail to interpret according to its literary style. The Bible is written in many literary form. Correct Bible interpretation requires that history be interpreted as history, allegory as allegory, poetry as poetry, etc. If we interpreted a newspaper as allegory, we would miss the true message the newspaper was attempting to convey and we would be in error.. Many people do this with the Bible simply because they donΓÇÖt like the literal interpretation.</p> <p>The second great error made in reading the Bible is taking things out of context. Just because something happened in history, it does not mean the Bible teaches or supports it.</p> <p>Third, people have a pre-determined agenda. They approach the Bible to support their beliefs instead of letting the Bible shape their beliefs.</p> <p>Lastly, an error is made in focusing on the obscure instead of the plain. The main purpose of the Bible is to reveal Jesus Christ to mankind. The ΓÇ£main things are the plain things and the plain things are the main thingsΓÇ¥.</p> <h2 id="what-is-the-purpose-for-god-giving-us-his-word">What is the Purpose for God giving us His Word?</h2> <p>A principle that governs life is that if you do not know the purpose for something, you will abuse it. The same is true for the Bible. If you do know the purpose for it, you will abuse it. The Bible is not a book of science, although it is scientifically correct. The Bible is not a book of history, although it is historically accurate.</p> <p>There are four basic purposes to Scripture:</p> <ol type="1"> <li><p>Reveal the <strong>Savior<br /> <br /> </strong>GodΓÇÖs Word is the revelation of the <strong>Savior</strong>, the Lord Jesus Christ to man. The Bible is more than just an instruction manual for man, it contains GodΓÇÖs revelation of himself to us in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. The main purpose of the Bible is to reveal our Lord Jesus Christ that we might put our faith in Him.<br /> <br /> <span data-custom-style="MTB Scripture Block Char">John 20:31 but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you may have life in His name. NAS<br /> <br /> Heb 10:7 ΓÇ£In the volume of the book it is written of me, Lo I come to do thy willΓÇ¥ (KJV)</span><br /> <br /> The whole Bible, cover to cover, is first about Jesus Christ. Our God desires to have a relationship with us His creation. Relationship must always based on knowledge. God already knows us, we need to know Him. The Bible is GodΓÇÖs specific and infallible revelation to man of Himself that we might through faith have a relationship with the living God.<br /> <br /> Jesus said ΓÇ£<em>search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which testify of me. And ye will not come that ye might have life</em> (John 5:39-40). The religious Jews at the time of Christ (called Pharisees) knew the Scriptures and yet they were unable to recognize the Lord Jesus Christ when He walked on the earth.<br /> <br /> Its important that we just donΓÇÖt accumulate ΓÇ£head knowledgeΓÇ¥ about the Bible and miss the Savior in our own lives. One purpose of the Bible is to reveal the Savior Jesus Christ to us personally such that we might have a living relationship with Him.</p></li> <li><p>Enable us to be <strong>Successful</strong> in our Christian Life<br /> <br /> A second purpose of the Bible is to equip us to live a victorious and successful Christian life. The Scriptures provide the anchor, the support, the strength an direction to live a victorious Christian life. A successful Christian life is living a life that is Godly and righteous in an ungodly and unrighteous world (2Tim 3:12). A successful Christian life is a life of purpose, faith, patience and love (2Tim 3:10). A successful Christian life is a life where you remain true to the Lord Jesus despite every thing that tries to pull you away. It is a life where no matter what is happening on the outside, there is inner joy and peace because of your relationship and union with Christ.</p></li> <li><p>Bring us to <strong>Spiritual Maturity</strong><br /> <br /> A third purpose of the Bible is to bring us to spiritual maturity. PaulΓÇÖs son in the faith, Timothy, grew from a child to the point where be was Bishop of Ephesus. The Bible tells us the source of his growth.<br /> <br /> <span data-custom-style="MTB Scripture Block Char">2 Tim 3:15 and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. NKJV</span><br /> <br /> TimothyΓÇÖs maturity in the faith was the result of His knowing of the Scriptures. Its GodΓÇÖs desire that each Christian would grow from a spiritual baby to a spiritual man or woman. Heart knowledge of the Word of God will bring us to spiritual maturity.</p></li> <li><p>Equip us for <strong>Service<br /> <br /> </strong>Lastly the Bible equips us for service. Not only does God desire relationship with us, but He also has work for us to do. The Bible helps equip us to serve God.<br /> <br /> <span data-custom-style="MTB Scripture Block Char">2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work. NAS</span></p></li> </ol> <p><em><strong><u>How does the Bible do these things?<br /> </u></strong></em></p> <p>There are four ways the Bible helps do these things in our lives.</p> <ol type="1"> <li><p>Teaching<br /> <br /> The Scriptures provide the basis of all truth. GodΓÇÖs Word is the only source of absolute truth. The Bible instructs us in moral absolutes and in the unchanging truths of the ages.<br /> <br /> <span data-custom-style="MTB Scripture Block Char">John 17:17 "ΓÇª Thy word is truth. NAS</span><br /> <br /> We must obey and put into practice the teachings and things we learn from GodΓÇÖs Word.</p></li> <li><p>Reproof<br /> <br /> The Bible rebukes us when we are in sin that we might turn from our ways and turn back to His ways. There is power in the word of God to convict us of our sins and to turn us from the error of our ways. When GodΓÇÖs Word convicts us of our wrong doing and errors, we must repent (ask Jesus for forgiveness) and turn to obey GodΓÇÖs Word to the best of our ability.</p></li> <li><p>Correction<br /> <br /> Once we are convicted of our sin, the Bible corrects our ways. The Word of God comes to illuminate our sin and error that we might repent and change the way we walk.</p></li> <li><p>Instruction (Training) in righteousness<br /> <br /> The Bible educates and trains us on what thoughts and actions are pleasing to our Creator.<br /> <br /> <span data-custom-style="MTB Scripture Block Char">2Tim 3:16-17 Every Scripture is God-breathed (given by His inspiration) and profitable for instruction, for reproof and conviction of sin, for correction of error and discipline in obedience and for training in righteousness (that is holy living, in conformity to GodΓÇÖs will in thought, purpose and action), so that the man of God may be complete and proficient, well-fitted and thoroughly equipped for every good work. (AMP)</span></p></li> </ol> <p><em><strong><u><br /> Conclusion</u></strong></em></p> <p>It is my prayer that God would give you a hunger for His Word all the days of your life and that you would daily feed at the banqueting table of His Word that He has prepared for you. And above all, I pray that through GodΓÇÖs Word you might come to know the only true God and Jesus Christ the Eternal Word made flesh.</p> <p>As we close this chapter letΓÇÖs take a moment to thank God for His Word and take a moment to ask Him to help you know Him and to grow in your walk through knowledge, understanding and obedience to His Word.<br /> <br /> <em>Father God, I ask right now in the name of your Son Jesus Christ, that you give me a hunger for your Word all the days of my life. Help me to cleanse my ways by hiding your Word in my heart. Help me to know Jesus Christ through your Word. Help me to obey your Word. I ask you give me the Holy Spirit to open the eyes of my understanding that I might behold all the treasures you have for me in thy Holy Word.</em></p>
