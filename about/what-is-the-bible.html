<h1 id="what-is-the-bible-and-where-did-it-come-from">What is the Bible and where did it come from?<br /> </h1> <p>The word ΓÇ£BibleΓÇ¥ comes from a Greek word meaning ΓÇ£bookΓÇ¥. ΓÇ£The BibleΓÇ¥ means ΓÇ£The BookΓÇ¥. The Bible is really 66 books, written by 40 authors over 1,600 years.</p> <p>These books in the Bible were written by people from all walks of life: farmers, shepherds, fisherman, rich people, poor people, kings, priests, etc. The amazing thing is that all the books agree with each other despite being written by so many different types of people. The Bible essentially records each authorΓÇÖs particular experience with their Creator.</p> <h2 id="bible-basics"><br /> <br /> Bible Basics</h2> <p><em><strong><br /> </strong></em>There are two main divisions to the Bible: the Old Testament and the New Testament. There are 39 books in the Old Testament and 27 books in New Testament.</p> <p>Roman Catholic Bibles include some additional books called the ΓÇ£apocryphaΓÇ¥ or ΓÇÿhidden thingsΓÇÖ. These additional books are generally historical and accurate; however they are not considered to be part of inspired Scripture for the following reasons:</p> <ol type="1"> <li><p>They were not considered inspired Scripture by the Jews and were not included in the Hebrew Bible (our Old Testament)</p></li> <li><p>They were not quoted by Jesus</p></li> <li><p>They contain numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies</p></li> <li><p>Jerome did not consider them inspired Scripture in his Latin Vulgate Bible.</p></li> <li><p>For most of church history, the Apocrypha was considered ΓÇ£suitable for readingΓÇ¥ but not inspired Scripture.</p></li> </ol> <h2 id="the-old-testament">The Old Testament</h2> <p>The Old Testament is a collection of Jewish writings that were considered to be GodΓÇÖs Word. These books were written from ~2,000 - 500 BC. The Old Testament is GodΓÇÖs ancient testament (solemn declaration) of History. The Old Testament contains the story of Creation, the fall of man, manΓÇÖs need for a Savior and GodΓÇÖs progressive revelation of Himself . The Old Testament ends looking forward to the coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.</p> <h2 id="the-new-testament">The New Testament</h2> <p>The New Testament tells of the fulfillment of the Old Testament promises. It is the testament of GodΓÇÖs saving work in Christ. The New Testament announces the arrival of the promised Savior and GodΓÇÖs teaching for believers today.</p> <h2 id="where-did-the-books-of-the-new-testament-come-from">Where did the books of the New Testament come from?</h2> <p>At first Christians did not have any of the books contained in our New Testament. They depended on the Old Testament, on oral tradition about Jesus and His teachings, and direct revelation from God through Christian prophets Over time, the words of Jesus were composed into books called the Gospels (Gospel means ΓÇ£good newsΓÇ¥). Letters of instruction and teaching were written by the apostles to the early church. These writings of the Apostles were almost unanimously recognized and accepted by the early church as ΓÇ£the Word of GodΓÇ¥.<br /> <br /> The original documents are called "autographs". No autographs are extant (existing) today. At first copies were made one by one until the demand increased, than a reader dictated to a roomful of copyists. Word divisions, punctuation marks, and chapter and first divisions were lacking at first and did not come until much later. The earliest manuscripts that we have today date from the ~140 AD. There are over 5,000 extant New Testament manuscripts as compared with most ancient writings in which there are anywhere from a few to a couple hundred extant manuscripts (Homer). In addition, the earliest extant manuscripts of ancient writings are hundreds of years from the date of the original as compared with the NT which is within ~110 years of Christ. This means, we are sure of what the New Testament text says and we are sure of its reliability</p> <h6 id="section"> </h6>
