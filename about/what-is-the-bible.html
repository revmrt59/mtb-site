          the Bible and where did it come from?<br />
          </h2>
          <p>The word “Bible” comes from a Greek word meaning “book”.
          “The Bible” means “The Book”. The Bible is really 66 books,
          written by 40 authors over 1,600 years.</p>
          <p>These books in the Bible were written by people from all
          walks of life: farmers, shepherds, fisherman, rich people,
          poor people, kings, priests, etc. The amazing thing is that
          all the books agree with each other despite being written by
          so many different types of people. The Bible essentially
          records each author’s particular experience with their
          Creator.</p>

          Bible Basics</h3>
          <p><em><strong><br />
          </strong></em>There are two main divisions to the Bible: the
          Old Testament and the New Testament. There are 39 books in the
          Old Testament and 27 books in New Testament.</p>
          <p>Roman Catholic Bibles include some additional books called
          the “apocrypha” or ‘hidden things’. These additional books are
          generally historical and accurate; however they are not
          considered to be part of inspired Scripture for the following
          reasons:</p>
          <ol type="1">
          <li><p>They were not considered inspired Scripture by the Jews
          and were not included in the Hebrew Bible (our Old
          Testament)</p></li>
          <li><p>They were not quoted by Jesus</p></li>
          <li><p>They contain numerous historical and geographical
          inaccuracies</p></li>
          <li><p>Jerome did not consider them inspired Scripture in his
          Latin Vulgate Bible.</p></li>
          <li><p>For most of church history, the Apocrypha was
          considered “suitable for reading” but not inspired
          Scripture.</p></li>
          </ol>
          <h3 id="the-old-testament">The Old Testament</h3>
          <p>The Old Testament is a collection of Jewish writings that
          were considered to be God’s Word. These books were written
          from ~2,000 - 500 BC. The Old Testament is God’s ancient
          testament (solemn declaration) of History. The Old Testament
          contains the story of Creation, the fall of man, man’s need
          for a Savior and God’s progressive revelation of Himself . The
          Old Testament ends looking forward to the coming of the
          Messiah, Jesus Christ.</p>
          <h3 id="the-new-testament">The New Testament</h3>
          <p>The New Testament tells of the fulfillment of the Old
          Testament promises. It is the testament of God’s saving work
          in Christ. The New Testament announces the arrival of the
          promised Savior and God’s teaching for believers today.</p>
          <h3
          id="where-did-the-books-of-the-new-testament-come-from">Where
          did the books of the New Testament come from?</h3>
          <p>At first Christians did not have any of the books contained
          in our New Testament. They depended on the Old Testament, on
          oral tradition about Jesus and His teachings, and direct
          revelation from God through Christian prophets Over time, the
          words of Jesus were composed into books called the Gospels
          (Gospel means “good news”). Letters of instruction and
          teaching were written by the apostles to the early church.
          These writings of the Apostles were almost unanimously
          recognized and accepted by the early church as “the Word of
          God”.<br />
          <br />
          The original documents are called "autographs". No autographs
          are extant (existing) today. At first copies were made one by
          one until the demand increased, than a reader dictated to a
          roomful of copyists. Word divisions, punctuation marks, and
          chapter and first divisions were lacking at first and did not
          come until much later. The earliest manuscripts that we have
          today date from the ~140 AD. There are over 5,000 extant New
          Testament manuscripts as compared with most ancient writings
          in which there are anywhere from a few to a couple hundred
          extant manuscripts (Homer). In addition, the earliest extant
          manuscripts of ancient writings are hundreds of years from the
          date of the original as compared with the NT which is within
          ~110 years of Christ. This means, we are sure of what the New
          Testament text says and we are sure of its reliability</p>
