<p>Many people say the Bible is a good book to try and live by but they don’t believe it is the true Word of God because it was written by men. Some people erroneously believe the Bible can not be without error because it was written by men.</p>
<p><em>These people are mistaken because the real author of the Bible is not man, but the God the Holy Spirit.<br />

<p><strong>2 TI 3:16</strong> “All Scripture is given by <strong>inspiration of God</strong>”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Greek word translated “inspiration of God” literally means “God breathed” thus indicating the source of the Bible is God Himself.</p>
<p>The Bible clearly declares itself to be God’s Word</p>
<div class="mtb-scripture-block">
<div>
<p><strong>2PE 1:21</strong> For prophecy [speaking of the Old Testament] never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. (NIV)</p>

<p><strong>Gal 1:11</strong> “I want you to know brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up”. (NAS)</p>

<p>Men may have penned the Bible, but the Holy Spirit is the author. The Holy Spirit inspired the authors and preserved their writings from error.</p>
<p>There are many other non-Scriptural evidences that the Bible is God’s inerrant and infallible Word. Some of these include</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>Unity of the Scriptures</u>: If the Bible was not Divinely inspired, how could all 66 books written by so many authors over such a long period agree? They could not.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Historical Accuracy</u>: Dr. Nelson Glueck, who is acknowledged as a leading Palestinian archaeologist of our times has said: “it may be stated categorical (i.e. it is fact) that no archeological discovery has ever proved the Bible wrong. Scores of archeological findings have been made which confirm in clear outline or in exact detail, historical statements in the Bible.”</p></li>
<li><p><u>Indestructibility</u>: Despite all the efforts of its enemies to destroy it [Diocletian, Voltaire, Gibbon, Hume, Paine, Huxley, Carl Sagan and even modern science], the Bible is still read more than any other book by far. The Bible is still annually the world’s best selling book.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Superior Standards</u>: Throughout all of history, the Bible has held up moral standards far superior to those philosophers of all ages. The teachings of Buddha, Plato, and others are “gropings in the dark” when compared to Jesus Christ who is the “light of the world”. Such an absolute standard could not come from man, but only God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The “Empty Tomb”</u>: In his book “Born Again”, Chuck Colson notes how he a few of the most powerful men on earth could not keep things quiet with regards to Watergate to save their skin, their power and their position; yet Jesus disciples - eleven unlearned men with nothing to gain, went to their death because they said they saw Jesus Christ alive and resurrected from the dead. Ten out of eleven Apostles were willing to die because they said Jesus rose from the dead (the eleventh John, suffered arrest and exile). First Corinthians chapter 15 says that over 500 witnesses saw Jesus Christ resurrected from the dead.<br />
<br />
The willingness of these early apostles to die because they saw Jesus Christ rise from the dead and ascend into heaven coupled with the reliability, authenticity and abundance of the New Testament manuscripts, declare with as much proof as any other event in history that Jesus Christ rose from the dead and the things written about him in the New Testament are true.</p></li>

<h2 id="the-bible-is-gods-inerrant-and-infallible-word">The Bible is God’s Inerrant and Infallible Word</h2>
<p>Because the origin of Scripture is God and because God can not lie and is perfect, His Word is <u>infallible</u> and <u>inerrant</u> (without error).</p>
<p>Because God’s Word is infallible, Scripture is the <u>sole source</u> for the truth of our faith. The primary way in which God speaks and directs us is through His Word. God will speak to our hearts with His Spirit; however it is always in accordance with His Word. God’s Word, the Bible, is the standard by which all things are judged and measured as God never contradicts Himself in His written Word.</p>
<p>Inerrancy means that the Bible is without error in that it tells the “truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth”. If there was one error in the Bible, then the whole Bible becomes completely unreliable. The Bible contains no errors and so if we see a difficulty in the Bible, it is not a problem with God’s Word, it is a problem with our understanding.</p>
<h2 id="why-dont-people-want-to-believe-the-bible-is-the-word-of-god">Why don’t people want to believe the Bible is the Word of God?</h2>
<p><em><strong><br />
</strong></em>The real reason that people do not want to believe the Bible and live by according to it’s teachings is that the Bible exposes the sin of man. When someone accepts the Bible as God’s Word, they are no longer free to do their own thing.</p>
<div class="mtb-scripture-block">
<div>
<p><strong>John 3:19</strong> “Men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some other reasons people do not want to believe the Bible is that they do not want to admit they will have to answer to God on judgment day. In addition, man’s pride makes them want to believe they are in control of everything, whereas the Bible declares there is only one who is in ultimate control of all things.</p>
