<p><strong>The Lens for Reading &amp; Understanding Scripture</strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose of This Document</strong></p>
<p>This document defines the governing lens through which Scripture is to be read, explained, interpreted, and applied within <em>Mastering the Bible</em>. It is not a commentary method, a devotional guide, or a statement of faith. It functions as an interpretive and pastoral framework that precedes explanation and constrains interpretation.</p>
<p>This lens answers one primary question: How must Scripture be approached so that it gives life rather than merely information?</p>
<p><strong>This document gives a governing, hermeneutical and pastoral lens for reading Scripture as life-giving revelation rather than mere information.</strong> Think of it as the operating system of the Scriptures.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Concept of a Lens</strong></p>
<p>A lens is both:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a physical means by which light is focused, and</p></li>
<li><p>a metaphorical channel through which something is understood.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Jesus directly addressed the importance of our interpretive lens:</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 6:22–23</strong> <em>“The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!”</em> (NKJV)</p>
<p>The issue Jesus raises is not the absence of light, but the condition of the lens through which light is received. The lens addresses <em>how we see</em>, not what we see. This reminds us of Jesus word’s to “Take heed how you hear" (Luke 8:18).</p>
<p>In the same way, Scripture does not fail to give light. What determines whether Scripture produces light or darkness in the reader is the lens through which it is approached.<br />
<br />
<em>Scripture must be read through a lens that allows light and life to pass through, not merely information.</em></p>
<p><strong>2. Tree of Knowledge and Tree of Life</strong></p>
<p>From the beginning, Scripture presents two ways of relating to what God speaks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The tree of knowledge, which produces death when grasped apart from God</p></li>
<li><p>The tree of life, which produces eternal life</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Scripture can be handled as <em><strong>knowledge to be consumed</strong></em>, or as <em><strong>life to be received</strong>.</em></p>
<p>Jesus makes this distinction explicit:</p>
<p><strong>John 6:63</strong> <em>“It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life.”</em> (NKJV)</p>
<p>The words of Scripture are not merely informational. They are spiritual containers, carrying life when received in alignment with God’s intent.</p>
<p>Therefore, Scripture is not meant merely to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>known,</p></li>
<li><p>argued,</p></li>
<li><p>mastered intellectually.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is meant to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>nourish the inner man,</p></li>
<li><p>impart life,</p></li>
<li><p>draw the reader into living relationship with God.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Simply put, the Bible is spiritual in nature and intended to impart life, not just convey facts.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Nature of Scripture</strong></p>
<p>Although the Bible is historically and scientifically true, it is not meant to be read <em>merely</em> through an intellectual lens.</p>
<p>Scripture is spiritual in nature and must be understood spiritually in order to accomplish its purpose.</p>
<p>To read Scripture only as information is to reduce it below its intended function; like Adam eating from the tree of knowledge, <em>it leads to spiritual death</em>.</p>
<p>Scripture is designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>reveal God,</p></li>
<li><p>communicate His heart,</p></li>
<li><p>draw us into a relationship with Jesus through the Holy Spirit</p></li>
<li><p>and bring us into deeper communion and life with Jesus</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Might I word it like this? Scripture exists to reveal God’s eternal purpose of union with humanity in Christ. This helps address “What is God ultimately doing through Scripture?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4. God’s Eternal Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The Bible must be read through the lens of God’s eternal purpose.</p>
<p>That purpose is simple and consistent throughout Scripture:</p>
<p>God desires to dwell with humanity so that we may live with Him, know Him, and enjoy Him forever.</p>
<p>This purpose unfolds progressively:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First in the garden,</p></li>
<li><p>Then in Israel,</p></li>
<li><p>Now in believers through Christ,</p></li>
<li><p>And ultimately in eternity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Jesus prays this glorious invitation and mystery explicitly: <strong>John 17</strong> <em>“I in them, and You in Me…”</em> (NKJV)</p>
<p>Scripture reveals God’s desire for union, not merely obedience.</p>
<p>This is why Jesus is described as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world,</p></li>
<li><p>the one in whom all things are restored,</p></li>
<li><p>the full revelation of God’s character.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Scripture Is About Jesus</strong></p>
<p>Jesus Himself establishes the center of Scripture:</p>
<p><strong>John 5:39</strong> <em>“You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me.”</em> (NKJV)</p>
<p>Scripture is not primarily about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>moral improvement,</p></li>
<li><p>a list of do’s and don’t</p></li>
<li><p>religious performance,</p></li>
<li><p>or human effort.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is about the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The volume of the book is centered on revealing Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>Hebrews 10:6-7</strong> <em>In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You had no pleasure. 7 Then I said, “Behold, I have come— In the volume of the book it is written of Me— To do Your will, O God.’ ”</em> (NKJV)</p>
<p>The Bible reveals God’s fullness through Christ and points relentlessly toward Him.</p>
<p><strong>6. God’s Character as the Interpretive Guardrail</strong></p>
<p>Scripture must always be interpreted in light of God’s revealed character.</p>
<p>This includes the following non-negotiable truths:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>God is infinitely Good.</p></li>
<li><p>God is infinitely Holy (unlike any other)</p></li>
<li><p>God is perfect and just in all His ways.</p></li>
<li><p>God loves humanity immeasurably.</p></li>
<li><p>God always has our eternal best interest in mind.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>God’s commands do not flow from control or threat, but from His heart of love.</p>
<p>God hates sin not because it violates rules, but because of what it does to us and to others, and how it separates us from Him.</p>
<p>Any interpretation of Scripture that portrays God as arbitrary, cruel, unsafe, or opposed to human good, or outside His declared purposes, fails to interpret Scripture, misses the mark.</p>
<p><strong>7. The Purpose of Scripture</strong></p>
<p>Scripture itself defines its purpose:</p>
<p><strong>1 Timothy 1:5</strong> <em>“The purpose of my instruction is that all believers would be filled with love that comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and genuine faith.”</em> (NLT-SE)</p>
<p>Scripture is given so that we would:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>love God,</p></li>
<li><p>love others,</p></li>
<li><p>be transformed into the likeness of Christ,</p></li>
<li><p>trust God completely,</p></li>
<li><p>and walk in ways that align with His character.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The ultimate goal is not behavior modification, but relational transformation. Any other teaching or understanding from the word outside of this, while true, is unhealthy and outside of God’s declared and clear purpose.</p>
<p><strong>8. First the Natural, Then the Spiritual</strong></p>
<p>Scripture frequently communicates spiritual truth through natural events.</p>
<p><strong>1 Corinthians 15:46</strong> <em>“However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual.”</em> (NKJV)</p>
<p>Historical realities in Scripture are real events, but they also function as spiritual revelations.</p>
<p>For example, the stoning of Sabbath violators in Israel illustrates that refusing God’s rest produces death.</p>
<p>Paul explicitly teaches this principle by recounting Israel’s concrete historical experiences—deliverance, provision, failure, and judgment—and showing in 1 Corinthians 10 that these outward events flowed from inward spiritual realities, revealing how life flows from trust in God, while misplaced desire and unbelief lead to loss and death.</p>
<p>The natural must be honored first, but it is not the final meaning unless it leads us to life.</p>
<p><strong>9. How This Lens Governs Explanation and Insight</strong></p>
<p>Scripture is first given to be received personally before it is ever explained or shared with others.</p>
<p>In approaching Scripture, we must first explain (this is knowledge). Explanation must:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>honor historical and textual meaning,</p></li>
<li><p>show what the text is doing,</p></li>
<li><p>remain faithful to God’s goodness and redemptive intent.</p></li>
<li><p>What reality is God revealing here?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then we should seek insight as to how this applies to me. This is where Scripture becomes “manna”. When we gain knowledge of the holy One, it then becomes understanding. Insights should:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>connect ancient text to present spiritual reality,</p></li>
<li><p>assume God’s goodness,</p></li>
<li><p>leads toward trust, rest, obedience, and life.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw us to God</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Tithing is a good example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tithing is one of the clearest places people default to a tree-of-knowledge, law-burden reading, despite Jesus’ affirmation we should still tithe Mat 23:23).</p>
<p>Instead of seeing tithing as a legal requirement placed on God’s people. Tithing reflects a heart posture that declares God as first in my life and that I trust that God is the source of life and provision, and that placing Him first orders the rest of life rightly.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some other examples of this.</p>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Instead of: “Forgiveness is a command God gives that we must obey.” We see instead: “Forgiveness reveals a spiritual reality: refusing to release others binds the heart to offense and death, while forgiving opens the way for freedom, healing, and restored life.”</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Instead of: Israel complained and was punished. We see instead: Israel’s complaints reveal how unbelief and mistrust distort the heart, cutting people off from the life God intends to give. Ingratitude towards results in spiritual death.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Instead of: “Israel failed to keep the law.” We see: “The law exposes our inability to produce life on our own and points us toward dependence on God.”</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>In reading and understanding through the framework and lens, Scripture does not become just information but rather an invitation into a deeper walk with God.</p>
<p><strong>10. The Song of Songs as the Heart of Scripture</strong></p>
<p>The Song of Songs stands as the Holy of Holies of Scripture, revealing the heart of God and the ultimate aim of His Word.</p>
<p>It tells the story of a bride who is dark yet lovely - marked by brokenness and sin, yet created in the image of God and deeply loved by Him. She is drawn into covenant with the shepherd-king-bridegroom, Christ Himself. The book traces her journey from awakening love to mature union.</p>
<p>The Song portrays the entire movement of Scripture in relational form:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Life is found under a tree (pointing to the cross of Christ), not through knowledge alone.</p></li>
<li><p>The bride is brought into the house of wine, speaking of the Spirit’s intoxicating love.</p></li>
<li><p>The beloved is a bundle of myrrh, revealing the Savior’s suffering love that is held close to the heart and sustains in the night seasons.</p></li>
<li><p>Though the bride does not always respond rightly, the bridegroom continues to woo, pursue, and invite her higher up the mountain.</p></li>
<li><p>The journey culminates with the bride coming out of the wilderness (our life on earth) leaning on her beloved, walking into eternity with Jesus, sealed with the flame of Yah - love as strong as death.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is not allegory imposed on Scripture, but revelation unveiled by Scripture itself. The Song of Songs reveals that God’s goal has never been mere obedience, rule-keeping, or information, but covenantal love that transforms the heart and brings us into close union and relationship with Him.</p>
<p>Only after receiving the Shepherd-King-Bridegroom’s love for us, can we then in turn love Him. And then only will this love for Him motivate us to die to self (SOS 8:6). Only love sustains the long journey of transformation. The Song of Songs captures the inner meaning of all Scripture: God drawing humanity into eternal union with Himself.</p>
<p>If you want to know what the Bible is really about, read everything in light of this love story.</p>
