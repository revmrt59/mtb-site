          <h2 id="why-are-there-so-many-translations-of-the-bible">Why
          are there so many translations of the Bible?</h2>
          <p>The Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew and the
          New Testament written in Greek. Whenever one translates from
          one language to another, the translator must decided if they
          should translate “word-for-word” or “thought-for-thought”.</p>
          <p>As an example, if you were translating the English phrase
          “he was born with a silver spoon in their mouth” into another
          language, you would need to decide if you would translate the
          phase “word-for-word” which would leave the hearer with a
          picture of a baby being born with a spoon in their mouth. Or
          you would have to decide if you wanted to translate the
          thought of the phrase in which case you would translate as “he
          was born to rich parents in a rich home”.</p>
          <p>The various translations primarily reflect different
          degrees of “word-for-word” or “thought-for-thought”
          translations. The NIV tends to be a more “thought-for-thought”
          translation than the New American Standard or the King James
          Version.</p>
          <p>The various translations also reflect the desired reading
          level and difficulty in English. In other words, some
          translations require a higher reading level and vocabulary
          than others.</p>

          id="are-there-many-interpretations-to-the-bible"><u>Are There
          Many Interpretations to the Bible?</u></p>
          <p>Some people erroneously claim that people interpret the
          Bible differently so how do they know what to believe and that
          it can mean what ever one wants it to mean. The Bible is
          clear, God only has one meaning to each passage or verse in
          the Bible.</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p><strong>2 Peter 1:20</strong> <em>But know this first of
          all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one's own
          interpretation</em> NAS</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>There are four main errors people make in reading and
          interpreting the Bible:</p>
          <p>First, they fail to interpret according to its literary
          style. The Bible is written in many literary form. Correct
          Bible interpretation requires that history be interpreted as
          history, allegory as allegory, poetry as poetry, etc. If we
          interpreted a newspaper as allegory, we would miss the true
          message the newspaper was attempting to convey and we would be
          in error.. Many people do this with the Bible simply because
          they don’t like the literal interpretation.</p>
          <p>The second great error made in reading the Bible is taking
          things out of context. Just because something happened in
          history, it does not mean the Bible teaches or supports
          it.</p>
          <p>Third, people have a pre-determined agenda. They approach
          the Bible to support their beliefs instead of letting the
          Bible shape their beliefs.</p>
          <p>Lastly, an error is made in focusing on the obscure instead
          of the plain. The main purpose of the Bible is to reveal Jesus
          Christ to mankind. The “main things are the plain things and
          the plain things are the main things”.</p>
          <p><em><strong><br />
          <u>What is the Purpose for God giving us His
          Word?</u></strong><u><br />
          </u></em>A principle that governs life is that if you do not
          know the purpose for something, you will abuse it. The same is
          true for the Bible. If you do know the purpose for it, you
          will abuse it. The Bible is not a book of science, although it
          is scientifically correct. The Bible is not a book of history,
          although it is historically accurate.</p>
          <p>There are four basic purposes to Scripture:</p>
          <ol type="1">
          <li><p>Reveal the <strong>Savior<br />
          <br />
          </strong>God’s Word is the revelation of the
          <strong>Savior</strong>, the Lord Jesus Christ to man. The
          Bible is more than just an instruction manual for man, it
          contains God’s revelation of himself to us in the person of
          the Lord Jesus Christ. The main purpose of the Bible is to
          reveal our Lord Jesus Christ that we might put our faith in
          Him.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>John 20:31</strong> <em>but these have been written
          that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God;
          and that believing you may have life in His name.</em>
          NAS<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Heb 10:7</strong> <em>“In the volume of the book it is
          written of me, Lo I come to do thy will”</em> (KJV)<br />
          <br />
          The whole Bible, cover to cover, is first about Jesus Christ.
          Our God desires to have a relationship with us His creation.
          Relationship must always based on knowledge. God already knows
          us, we need to know Him. The Bible is God’s specific and
          infallible revelation to man of Himself that we might through
          faith have a relationship with the living God.<br />
          <br />
          Jesus said “<em>search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye
          have eternal life; and they are they which testify of me. And
          ye will not come that ye might have life</em> (John 5:39-40).
          The religious Jews at the time of Christ (called Pharisees)
          knew the Scriptures and yet they were unable to recognize the
          Lord Jesus Christ when He walked on the earth.<br />
          <br />
          Its important that we just don’t accumulate “head knowledge”
          about the Bible and miss the Savior in our own lives. One
          purpose of the Bible is to reveal the Savior Jesus Christ to
          us personally such that we might have a living relationship
          with Him.</p></li>
          <li><p>Enable us to be <strong>Successful</strong> in our
          Christian Life<br />
          <br />
          A second purpose of the Bible is to equip us to live a
          victorious and successful Christian life. The Scriptures
          provide the anchor, the support, the strength an direction to
          live a victorious Christian life. A successful Christian life
          is living a life that is Godly and righteous in an ungodly and
          unrighteous world (2Tim 3:12). A successful Christian life is
          a life of purpose, faith, patience and love (2Tim 3:10). A
          successful Christian life is a life where you remain true to
          the Lord Jesus despite every thing that tries to pull you
          away. It is a life where no matter what is happening on the
          outside, there is inner joy and peace because of your
          relationship and union with Christ.</p></li>
          <li><p>Bring us to <strong>Spiritual Maturity</strong><br />
          <br />
          A third purpose of the Bible is to bring us to spiritual
          maturity. Paul’s son in the faith, Timothy, grew from a child
          to the point where be was Bishop of Ephesus. The Bible tells
          us the source of his growth.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>2 Tim 3:15</strong> <em>and that from childhood you
          have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you
          wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ
          Jesus.</em> NKJV<br />
          <br />
          Timothy’s maturity in the faith was the result of His knowing
          of the Scriptures. Its God’s desire that each Christian would
          grow from a spiritual baby to a spiritual man or woman. Heart
          knowledge of the Word of God will bring us to spiritual
          maturity.</p></li>
          <li><p>Equip us for <strong>Service<br />
          <br />
          </strong>Lastly the Bible equips us for service. Not only does
          God desire relationship with us, but He also has work for us
          to do. The Bible helps equip us to serve God.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>2 Timothy 3:16-17</strong> <em>All Scripture is
          inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for
          correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God
          may be adequate, equipped for every good work.</em>
          NAS</p></li>
          </ol>
          <p><em><strong><u>How does the Bible do these things?<br />
          </u></strong></em></p>
          <p>There are four ways the Bible helps do these things in our
          lives.</p>
          <ol type="1">
          <li><p>Teaching<br />
          <br />
          The Scriptures provide the basis of all truth. God’s Word is
          the only source of absolute truth. The Bible instructs us in
          moral absolutes and in the unchanging truths of the
          ages.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>John 17:17</strong> <em>"… Thy word is truth.</em>
          NAS<br />
          <br />
          We must obey and put into practice the teachings and things we
          learn from God’s Word.</p></li>
          <li><p>Reproof<br />
          <br />
          The Bible rebukes us when we are in sin that we might turn
          from our ways and turn back to His ways. There is power in the
          word of God to convict us of our sins and to turn us from the
          error of our ways. When God’s Word convicts us of our wrong
          doing and errors, we must repent (ask Jesus for forgiveness)
          and turn to obey God’s Word to the best of our
          ability.</p></li>
          <li><p>Correction<br />
          <br />
          Once we are convicted of our sin, the Bible corrects our ways.
          The Word of God comes to illuminate our sin and error that we
          might repent and change the way we walk.</p></li>
          <li><p>Instruction (Training) in righteousness<br />
          <br />
          The Bible educates and trains us on what thoughts and actions
          are pleasing to our Creator.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>2Tim 3:16-17</strong> <em>Every Scripture is
          God-breathed (given by His inspiration) and profitable for
          instruction, for reproof and conviction of sin, for correction
          of error and discipline in obedience and for training in
          righteousness (<u>that is holy living, in conformity to God’s
          will in thought, purpose and action</u>), so that the man of
          God may be complete and proficient, well-fitted and thoroughly
          equipped for every good work.</em> (AMP)</p></li>
          </ol>
          <p><em><strong><u><br />
          Conclusion</u></strong></em></p>
          <p>It is my prayer that God would give you a hunger for His
          Word all the days of your life and that you would daily feed
          at the banqueting table of His Word that He has prepared for
          you. And above all, I pray that through God’s Word you might
          come to know the only true God and Jesus Christ the Eternal
          Word made flesh.</p>
          <p>As we close this chapter let’s take a moment to thank God
          for His Word and take a moment to ask Him to help you know Him
          and to grow in your walk through knowledge, understanding and
          obedience to His Word.<br />
          <br />
          <em>Father God, I ask right now in the name of your Son Jesus
          Christ, that you give me a hunger for your Word all the days
          of my life. Help me to cleanse my ways by hiding your Word in
          my heart. Help me to know Jesus Christ through your Word. Help
          me to obey your Word. I ask you give me the Holy Spirit to
          open the eyes of my understanding that I might behold all the
          treasures you have for me in thy Holy Word.</em></p>
