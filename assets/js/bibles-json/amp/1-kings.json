Go tell your master, \u0027Elijah is here.\u0027\"","26":"So they took the bull that was given to them and prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, \"O Baal, hear and answer us.\" But there was no voice and no one answered. And they leaped about the altar which they had made.","39":"When all the people saw it, they fell face downward; and they said, \"The LORD, He is God! The LORD, He is God!\"","14":"And now you are saying, \u0027Go, tell your master, \"Elijah is here\"\u0027; and he will kill me.\"","37":"Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so that this people may know that You, O LORD, are God, and that You have turned their hearts back [to You].\"","22":"Then Elijah said to the people, \"I alone remain a prophet of the LORD, while Baal\u0027s prophets are 450 men.","28":"So they cried out with a loud voice [to get Baal\u0027s attention] and cut themselves with swords and lances in accordance with their custom, until the blood flowed out on them.","25":"Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, \"Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare it first, since there are many of you; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.\"","9":"But he said, \"What sin have I committed, that you would hand over your servant to Ahab to put me to death?","33":"Then he laid out the wood and cut the ox in pieces and laid it on the wood.","15":"Elijah said, \"As the LORD of hosts (armies) lives, before whom I stand, I will certainly show myself to Ahab today.\"","34":"And he said, \"Fill four pitchers with water and pour it on the burnt offering and the wood.\" And he said, \"Do it the second time.\" And they did it the second time. And he said, \"Do it the third time.\" And they did it a third time.","21":"Elijah approached all the people and said, \"How long will you hesitate between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.\" But the people [of Israel] did not answer him [so much as] a word.","24":"Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD; and the god who answers by fire, He is God.\" And all the people answered, \"It is well spoken.\"","46":"Then the hand of the LORD came upon Elijah [giving him supernatural strength]. He girded up his loins and outran Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel [nearly twenty miles].","16":"So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.","35":"The water flowed around the altar, and he also filled the trench with water.","32":"So with the stones Elijah built an altar in the name of the LORD. He made a trench around the altar large enough to hold two measures of seed.","7":"As Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him. He recognized him and fell face downward [out of respect] and said, \"Is it you, my lord Elijah?\"","43":"and he said to his servant, \"Go up, look toward the sea.\" So he went up and looked and said, \"There is nothing.\" Elijah said, \"Go back\" seven times.","2":"So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria.","38":"Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood, and even the stones and the dust; it also licked up the water in the trench.","6":"So they divided the land between them to survey it. Ahab went one way by himself and Obadiah went another way by himself.","31":"Then Elijah took twelve stones in accordance with the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, \"Israel shall be your name.\""},"12":{"11":"And now, whereas my father loaded you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke.

Such almug wood did not come in [to Israel] again, nor has it been seen to this day.","10":"She gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold and a very great quantity of spices and precious stones. Never again did such an abundance of spices come in [to Israel] as that which the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.","17":"He made three hundred smaller shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon [the king\u0027s armory].","13":"King Solomon [in turn] gave to the queen of Sheba everything that she wanted, whatever she asked, besides what he gave to her from his royal bounty. So she returned to her own country, she and her servants.","27":"The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars as plentiful as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland.","18":"Also the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with the finest gold.","29":"A chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and in the same way they exported them, by the king\u0027s merchants, to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram (Syria).","23":"So King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in wealth and in wisdom.","19":"The throne had six steps, and a round top was attached to the throne from the back.

She said, \"Do you come in peace?\" And he said, \"In peace.\"","27":"So Solomon dismissed Abiathar [a descendant of Eli] from being priest to the LORD, fulfilling the word of the LORD, which He had spoken concerning the house (descendants) of Eli in Shiloh.","30":"So Benaiah came to the tent of the LORD and told Joab, \"This is what the king commands, \u0027Come out of there.\u0027\" But Joab said, \"No, for I will die here.\" Then Benaiah brought word to the king again, saying, \"This is what Joab said, and this is how he answered me.\"","18":"Bathsheba replied, \"Very well; I will speak to the king for you.\"","36":"Now the king sent word and called for Shimei and said to him, \"Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there.
