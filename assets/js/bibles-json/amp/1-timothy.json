bully nor quick-tempered and hot-headed, but gentle and considerate, free from the love of money [not greedy for wealth and its inherent power—financially ethical].","5":"(for if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?).","12":"Deacons must be husbands of only one wife, and good managers of their children and their own households.","10":"These men must first be tested; then if they are found to be blameless and beyond reproach [in their Christian lives], let them serve as deacons.","2":"Now an overseer must be blameless and beyond reproach, the husband of one wife, self-controlled, sensible, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,","8":"Deacons likewise must be men worthy of respect [honorable, financially ethical, of good character], not double-tongued [speakers of half-truths], not addicted to wine, not greedy for dishonest gain,","11":"Women must likewise be worthy of respect, not malicious gossips,

all godliness and dignity.","8":"Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger and disputing or quarreling or doubt [in their mind].","11":"A woman must quietly

made concerning you, so that [inspired and aided] by them you may fight the good fight [in contending with false teachers],","12":"I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has granted me [the needed]

Teach and urge these [duties and principles].","8":"But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content.","17":"As for the rich in this present world, instruct them not to be conceited and arrogant, nor to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly and ceaselessly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.","11":"But as for you, O man of God, flee from these things; aim at and pursue righteousness [true goodness, moral conformity to the character of God], godliness [the fear of God], faith, love, steadfastness, and gentleness.","1":"All who are under the yoke as bond-servants (slaves) are to regard their own masters as worthy of honor and respect so that the name of God and the teaching [about Him] will not be spoken against.","9":"But those who [are not financially ethical and] crave to get rich [with a compulsive, greedy longing for wealth] fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction [leading to personal misery].","14":"to keep all His precepts without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,","7":"For we have brought nothing into the world, so [it is clear that] we cannot take anything out of it, either.","15":"which He will bring about in His own time—He who is the blessed and only Sovereign [the absolute Ruler], the King of those who reign as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords,","20":"O Timothy, guard and keep safe the deposit [of godly truth] entrusted to you, turn away from worldly and godless chatter [with its profane, empty words], and the contradictions of what is falsely called \"knowledge\"—","6":"But godliness actually is a source of great gain when accompanied by contentment [that contentment which comes from a sense of inner confidence based on the sufficiency of God].","4":"he is conceited and woefully ignorant [understanding nothing].
