This [person, the kind who does this] is the deceiver and the antichrist [that is, the antagonist of Christ].","6":"And this is love: that we walk in accordance with His commandments and are guided continually by His precepts. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should [always] walk in love.","4":"I was greatly delighted to find some of your children walking in truth, just as we have been commanded by the Father.","13":"The children of your elect (chosen) sister greet you."}}}
