They besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome and conquer him.","18":"He removed from the house of the LORD the covered way for the Sabbath which they had built in the house, and the outer entrance of the king, because of the king of Assyria [who might confiscate them].","12":"When the king came from Damascus, he saw the altar; then the king approached the altar and offered [sacrifices] on it,","10":"Now King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser the king of Assyria, and saw the pagan altar which was at Damascus. Then King Ahaz sent a model of the altar to Urijah the priest along with a [detailed] pattern for all its construction.","2":"Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in the sight of the LORD his God, as his father (ancestor) David had done.","8":"And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king\u0027s house, and sent a gift to the king of Assyria.","17":"Then King Ahaz cut away the frames of the basin stands [in the temple], and removed the basin from [each of] them; and he took down the [large] Sea from the bronze oxen which were under it, and put it on a plastered stone floor.","11":"So Urijah the priest built an altar; in accordance with everything that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, that is how Urijah the priest made it before King Ahaz returned from Damascus.","1":"In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham, king of Judah, became king.","9":"So the king of Assyria listened to him; and he went up against Damascus and captured it, and carried its people away into exile to Kir, and put Rezin [king of Aram] to death.","14":"He brought the bronze altar, which was before the LORD, from the front of the house (temple), from between the [new] altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the [new] altar.","7":"So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, \"I am your servant and son. Come up and rescue me from the hand of the kings of Aram and of Israel, who are rising up against me.\"","15":"Then King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, \"Upon the great [new] altar, burn the morning burnt offering and the evening grain offering, and the king\u0027s burnt offering and his grain offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their grain offering and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on the new altar all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice. But the [old] bronze altar shall be kept for me to use to examine the sacrifices.\"","20":"So Ahaz slept with his fathers [in death] and was buried with his fathers in the City of David; and his son Hezekiah became king in his place.","6":"At that time Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath [in Edom] for Aram, and drove the Jews away from it. The Arameans came to Elath, and live there to this day.","4":"He also sacrificed and burned incense on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.","19":"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?","13":"and burned his burnt offering and his grain offering, and poured out his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar."},"3":{"11":"But Jehoshaphat said, \"Is there no prophet of the LORD here from whom we may inquire of the LORD?\" One of the servants of the king of Israel answered, \"Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who used to pour water over Elijah\u0027s hands.\"","3":"Nevertheless, he continued in the [idolatrous] sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin; he did not depart from them.","20":"It happened in the morning, when the sacrifice was offered, that suddenly water came [miraculously] from the area of Edom, and the country was filled with water.","12":"Jehoshaphat said, \"The word of the LORD is with him.\" So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to Elisha.","10":"Then the king of Israel said, \"We are doomed, for the LORD has called these three kings to be handed over to Moab.\"","17":"For thus says the LORD, \u0027You will not see wind or rain, yet that valley will be filled with water, so you and your cattle and your other animals may drink.","13":"Now Elisha said to the king of Israel, \"What business do you have with me? Go to the prophets of your [wicked] father [Ahab] and to the prophets of your [pagan] mother [Jezebel].\" But the king of Israel said to him, \"No, for the LORD has called these three kings together to be handed over to Moab.\"","27":"Then the king of Moab took his eldest son, who was to reign in his place, and offered him [publicly] as a burnt offering [to Chemosh] on the [city] wall [horrifying everyone]. And there was great wrath against Israel, and Israel\u0027s allies [Judah and Edom] withdrew from King Jehoram and returned to their own land.","18":"This is but a simple thing in the sight of the LORD; He will also hand over the Moabites to you.","23":"And they said, \"This is blood!

And they stopped up all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees, until they left nothing in Kir-hareseth [Moab\u0027s capital city] but its stones. Then the [stone] slingers surrounded the city and destroyed it.","9":"So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. They made a circuit of seven days\u0027 journey, but there was no water for the army or for the cattle that followed them.","15":"But now bring me a musician.\" And it came about while the musician played, that the hand (power) of the LORD came upon Elisha.","21":"Now all the Moabites heard that the [three] kings had come up to fight against them, and all who were able to put on armor, as well as those who were older, were summoned and stood [together in battle formation] at the border.","24":"But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land, killing the Moabites [as they went].","16":"He said, \"Thus says the LORD, \u0027Make this valley (the Arabah) full of trenches.\u0027","7":"Then he went and sent word to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, saying, \"The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?\" And he replied, \"I will go; I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.\"","2":"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, but not like his father and mother; for he put away the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had made.","6":"So King Jehoram left Samaria at that time and assembled all [the fighting men of] Israel."},"5":{"11":"But Naaman was furious and went away and said, \"Indeed! I thought \u0027He would at least come out to [see] me and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place [of leprosy] and heal the leper.\u0027","3":"She said to her mistress, \"I wish that my master [Naaman] were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would heal him of his leprosy.\"","20":"when Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, \"My master has spared this Naaman the Aramean (Syrian), by not accepting from him what he brought. As the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him.\"","12":"Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus [in Aram], better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?\" So he turned and went away in a rage.","10":"Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, \"Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh will be restored to you and you will be clean.\"","17":"Naaman said, \"If not, then please, let your servant be given a load of earth for a team of mules; for [from this day on] your servant will no longer offer a burnt offering nor a sacrifice to other gods, but only to the LORD, [the God of Israel].","13":"Then his servants approached and said to him, \"My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more then, when he has said to you, \u0027Wash, and be clean?\u0027\"","27":"Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and to your descendants forever.\" So Gehazi departed from his presence, a leper as white as snow.","18":"In this matter may the LORD pardon your servant: when my master [the king] goes into the house of [his god] Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand and I bow in the house of Rimmon, when I bow down in the house of Rimmon, may the LORD pardon your servant in this matter [of attending the king when he worships].\"","23":"Naaman said, \"Please take two talents.\" And he urged him [to accept], and tied up two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes and gave them to two of his servants; and they carried them in front of Gehazi.","19":"Elisha said to him, \"Go in peace.\" So Naaman departed and was a good distance away from him,","1":"Now Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Aram (Syria), was considered a great man by his king, and was highly respected because through Naaman the LORD had given victory to Aram (Syria). He was also a man of courage, but he was a leper.","5":"Then the king of Aram (Syria) said, \"Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel (Jehoram the son of Ahab).\" So he left and took with him ten talents of silver and 6,000 shekels of gold, and ten changes of clothing.","4":"Naaman went in and told his master [the king], \"The girl who is from the land of Israel said such and such.\"","8":"Now when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent word to the king, asking, \"Why have you torn your clothes? Just let Naaman come to me, and he shall know that there is a [true] prophet in Israel.\"","26":"Elisha said to him, \"Did my heart not go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a [proper] time to accept money and clothing and olive orchards and vineyards and sheep and oxen and male and female servants?","14":"So he went down and plunged himself into the Jordan seven times, just as the man of God had said; and his flesh was restored like that of a little child and he was clean.","22":"And he said, \"All is well. My master has sent me to say, \u0027Just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothes.\u0027\"","25":"Then he went in and stood before his master. Elisha asked him, \"Where have you been, Gehazi?\" He said, \"Your servant went nowhere.\"","9":"So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stopped at the entrance of Elisha\u0027s house.","15":"Then Naaman returned to the man of God, he and all the people in his group, and stood before him. He said, \"Behold, I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel; so now accept a blessing and gift from your servant.\"","21":"So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him and said, \"Is all well?\"","24":"When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand and put them in the house [for safekeeping]; and he sent the men away, and they left.","16":"But Elisha said, \"As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will accept nothing.\" He urged him to take it, but Elisha refused.","7":"When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes [in shock and outrage at the request] and said, \"Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me [a request] to heal a man of his leprosy? Just consider [what he is asking] and see how he is seeking an opportunity [for a battle] with me.\"","2":"The Arameans (Syrians) had gone out in bands [as raiders] and had taken captive a little girl from the land of Israel; and she waited on Naaman\u0027s wife [as a servant].","6":"And he brought the letter to the king of Israel. It said, \"And now when this letter comes to you, I will have sent my servant Naaman to you, so that you may heal him of his leprosy.\""},"21":{"16":"Moreover, Manasseh shed a very great quantity of innocent blood, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin with which he made Judah sin, by doing evil in the sight of the LORD.","3":"For he rebuilt the high places [for the worship of pagan gods] which his father Hezekiah had destroyed; and he set up altars for Baal and made an [image of] Asherah, just as Ahab king of Israel had done, and he worshiped all the [starry] host of heaven and served them.","5":"And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courtyards of the house of the LORD.","21":"He walked in all the [evil] ways that his father had walked; and he served the idols that his father had served, and worshiped them;","18":"Manasseh slept with his fathers [in death] and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza. And his son Amon became king in his place.","12":"therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: \u0027Behold, I am bringing such catastrophe on Jerusalem and Judah, that everyone who hears of it, both of his ears will ring [from the shock].","10":"Now the LORD spoke through His servants the prophets, saying,","2":"He did [great] evil in the sight of the LORD, in accordance with the [idolatrous] repulsive acts of the [pagan] nations whom the LORD dispossessed before the sons (descendants) of Israel.","22":"he abandoned the LORD, the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the LORD.","8":"\"And I will not make the feet of Israel wander anymore from the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will be careful to act in accordance with everything that I have commanded them, and with all the law that My servant Moses commanded them.\"","17":"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, everything that he did, and the sin that he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?","11":"\"Because Manasseh king of Judah has committed these repulsive acts, having done more evil than all the Amorites did who were before him, and has also made Judah sin with his idols;","1":"Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother\u0027s name was Hephzibah.","9":"But they did not listen; and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the sons (descendants) of Israel.","24":"Then the people of the land [of Judah] killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.","14":"I will abandon the remnant (remainder) of My inheritance and hand them over to their enemies; and they will become plunder and spoil to all their enemies,","7":"He made a carved image of the [goddess] Asherah and set it up in the house (temple), of which the LORD said to David and to his son Solomon, \"In this house and in Jerusalem [in the tribe of Judah], which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will put My Name forever.","15":"because they have done evil in My sight, and have been provoking Me to anger, since the day their fathers came from Egypt to this day.\u0027\"","20":"He also did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as his father Manasseh had done.","25":"Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?","23":"But the servants of Amon conspired against him and killed the king in his own house (palace).","6":"He made his son pass through the fire and burned him [as an offering to Molech]; he practiced witchcraft and divination, and dealt with mediums and soothsayers. He did great evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger.","4":"And he built [pagan] altars in the house (temple) of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, \"In Jerusalem I will put My Name (Presence).\"","19":"Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother\u0027s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.","13":"I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem clean just as one wipes a [dirty] bowl clean, wiping it and turning it upside down.","26":"He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza, and his son Josiah became king in his place."},"18":{"11":"Then the king of Assyria sent Israel into exile to Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of [the city of] Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,","3":"Hezekiah did right in the sight of the LORD, in accordance with everything that David his father (ancestor) had done.","20":"You say (but they are only empty words) \u0027I have counsel and strength for the war.\u0027 Now on whom do you rely, that you have rebelled against me?","12":"because they did not obey the voice of the LORD their God, but broke His covenant, everything that Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded; and they would not listen nor do it.","10":"At the end of three years they captured it; in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Israel, Samaria was taken.","17":"Then the king of Assyria sent the Tartan and the Rab-saris and the Rabshakeh [his highest officials] with a large army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They went up and came to Jerusalem, and when they went up and arrived, they stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool, which is on the road of the Fuller\u0027s Field.","13":"In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria went up against all the fortified cities of Judah [except Jerusalem] and captured them.","27":"But the Rabshakeh said to them, \"Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to say these things? Has he not sent me to the men who sit on the wall, [who are doomed by the siege] to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine along with you?\"","30":"nor let Hezekiah make you trust in and rely on the LORD, saying, \"The LORD will certainly rescue us, and this city [of Jerusalem] will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.\"","18":"When they called for the king, Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the [king\u0027s] household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the secretary went out to [meet] them.","36":"But the people kept silent and did not answer him, for the king had commanded, \"Do not answer him.\"","29":"Thus says the king, \u0027Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to rescue you from my hand;","23":"Now then, make a bargain with my lord the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if on your part you can put riders on them.","19":"Then the Rabshakeh said to them, \"Say to Hezekiah, \u0027Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, \"What is [the reason for] this confidence that you have?","1":"Now it came about in the third year of Hoshea the son of Elah king of Israel, Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah became king.","5":"Hezekiah trusted in and relied confidently on the LORD, the God of Israel; so that after him there was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among those who were before him.","4":"He removed the high places [of pagan worship], broke down the images (memorial stones) and cut down the Asherim. He also crushed to pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the Israelites had burned incense to it; and it was called Nehushtan [a bronze sculpture].","8":"He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza [the most distant city] and its borders, from the [isolated] lookout tower to the [populous] fortified city.","26":"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna and Joah, said to the Rabshakeh, \"Please speak to your servants in the Aramaic (Syrian) language, because we understand it; and do not speak with us in the Judean (Hebrew) language in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.\"","14":"Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent word to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, \"I have done wrong. Withdraw from me; whatever you impose on me I will bear.\" So the king of Assyria imposed on Hezekiah king of Judah [a tribute tax of] three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.","37":"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the [royal] household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the secretary, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn [in grief and despair] and told him what the Rabshakeh had said.","22":"But if you tell me, \u0027We trust in and rely on the LORD our God,\u0027 is it not He whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, and has said to Judah and Jerusalem, \u0027You shall worship [only] before this altar in Jerusalem\u0027?","28":"Then the Rabshakeh stood and shouted out with a loud voice in Judean (Hebrew), \"Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.","25":"Now have I come up against this place to destroy it without the Lord\u0027s approval?

Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah [in the valley of the Euphrates]? Have they rescued Samaria (Israel\u0027s capital) from my hand?","21":"Now pay attention: you are relying on Egypt, on that staff of crushed reed; if a man leans on it, it will only go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust and rely on him.","24":"How then can you drive back even one official of the least of my master\u0027s servants, when you rely on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?","16":"At that time Hezekiah cut away the gold framework from the doors of the temple of the LORD and from the doorposts which he had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.","35":"Who among all the gods of the lands have rescued their lands from my hand, that the LORD would rescue Jerusalem from my hand?\u0027\"","32":"until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey, so that you may live and not die.\" Do not listen to Hezekiah when he misleads and incites you, saying, \"The LORD will rescue us!\"","7":"And the LORD was with Hezekiah; he was successful wherever he went. And he rebelled against the king of Assyria and refused to serve him.","2":"He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother\u0027s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah.","6":"For he clung to the LORD; he did not turn away from [faithfully] following Him, but he kept His commandments, which the LORD had commanded Moses.","31":"Do not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria: \"Surrender to me and come out to [meet] me, and every man may eat from his own vine and fig tree, and every man may drink the waters of his own well,"},"12":{"16":"Money from the guilt offerings and money from the sin offerings was not brought into the house of the LORD [for repairs]; it was for the priests.","3":"Only the high places were not removed; the people were still sacrificing and burning incense [to the LORD] on the high places [rather than at the temple].","5":"let the priests receive such contributions for themselves, each from his acquaintance; and they shall repair any breach in the house of the Lord, wherever a breach is found.\"","21":"For Jozacar (Jozachar) the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him and he died; and they buried Joash with his fathers in the City of David. Amaziah his son became king in his place.","18":"So Jehoash the king of Judah took all the sacred things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own sacred things and all the gold that was found in the treasuries of the house (temple) of the LORD and of the king\u0027s house, and sent them to Hazael king of Aram; and Hazael departed from Jerusalem.","12":"and to the masons and stonecutters, and to buy timber and hewn (cut) stone to repair any breach in the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for repairing the house.","10":"And whenever they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest, the king\u0027s scribe and the high priest came up and tied it in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of the LORD.","2":"Jehoash did right in the sight of the LORD all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him.","8":"So the priests agreed that they would receive no [more] money from the people, nor [be responsible to] repair the damages of the house.","17":"Then Hazael king of Aram (Syria) went up, fought against Gath [in Philistia], and captured it. And Hazael resolved to go up to Jerusalem.","11":"Then they gave the money, which was weighed out into the hands of those who were doing the work, who had the oversight of the house of the LORD; and they paid it out to the carpenters and builders who worked on the house (temple) of the LORD,","1":"In the seventh year of Jehu [king of Israel], Jehoash became king [over Judah], and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem.

Did I not say, \u0027Do not give me false hope\u0027?\"","25":"So she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her at a distance, he said to Gehazi his servant, \"Look, there is the Shunammite woman.","9":"She said to her husband, \"Behold, I sense that this is a holy man of God who frequently passes our way.","33":"So he went in, shut the door behind the two of them, and prayed to the LORD.","15":"He said, \"Call her.\" So Gehazi called her, and she [came and] stood in the doorway.","34":"Then he went up and lay on the child and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. And as he stretched himself out on him and held him, the boy\u0027s skin became warm.","21":"She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door [of the small upper room] behind him and left.","24":"Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, \"Drive [the animal] fast; do not slow down the pace for me unless I tell you.\"","16":"Elisha said, \"At this season next year, you will embrace a son.\" She said, \"No, my lord. O man of God, do not lie to your maidservant.\"","35":"Then he returned and walked in the house once back and forth, and went up [again] and stretched himself out on him; and the boy sneezed seven times and he opened his eyes.","32":"When Elisha came into the house, the child was dead and lying on his bed.","7":"Then she came and told the man of God. He said, \"Go, sell the oil and pay your debt, and you and your sons can live on the rest.\"","43":"His servant said, \"How am I to set [only] this before a hundred [hungry] men?\" He said, \"Give it to the people so that they may eat, for thus says the LORD, \u0027They shall eat and have some left.\u0027\"","2":"Elisha said to her, \"What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have [of value] in the house?\" She said, \"Your maidservant has nothing in the house except a [small] jar of [olive] oil.\"","38":"Elisha came back to Gilgal during a famine in the land. The sons of the prophets were sitting before him, and he said to his servant, \"Put on the large pot and cook stew for the sons of the prophets.\"","6":"When the containers were all full, she said to her son, \"Bring me another container.\" And he said to her, \"There is not a one left.\" Then the oil stopped [multiplying].","31":"Gehazi went on ahead of them and laid the staff on the boy\u0027s face, but there was no sound or response [from the boy]. So he turned back to meet Elisha and told him, \"The boy has not awakened (revived).\""},"19":{"11":"Listen, you have heard what the Assyrian kings have done to all the lands, destroying them completely. So will you be spared?","3":"They said to him, \"Thus says Hezekiah, \u0027This is a day of distress and anxiety, of punishment and humiliation; for children have come to [the time of their] birth and there is no strength to rescue them.","20":"Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent word to Hezekiah, saying, \"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: \u0027I have heard your prayer to Me regarding Sennacherib king of Assyria.\u0027","12":"Did the gods of the nations whom my forefathers destroyed rescue them—Gozan and Haran [of Mesopotamia] and Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?","10":"\"Say this to Hezekiah king of Judah, \u0027Do not let your God on whom you rely deceive you by saying, \"Jerusalem shall not be handed over to the king of Assyria.\"","17":"It is true, LORD, that the Assyrian kings have devastated the nations and their lands","13":"Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad [of northern Syria], the king of the city of Sepharvaim, and of Hena and Ivvah?\u0027\"","27":"\u0027But I [the LORD] know your sitting down [O Sennacherib], Your going out, your coming in, And your raging against Me.","30":"The survivors who remain of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.","18":"and have thrown their gods into the fire, for they were not [real] gods but [only] the work of men\u0027s hands, wood and stone. So they [could destroy them and] have destroyed them.","36":"So Sennacherib king of Assyria left and returned home, and lived at Nineveh.","29":"\u0027Then this shall be the sign [of these things] to you [Hezekiah]: this year you will eat what grows of itself, in the second year what springs up voluntarily, and in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.","23":"\u0027Through your messengers you have taunted and defied the Lord, And have said [boastfully], \"With my many chariots I came up to the heights of the mountains, To the remotest parts of Lebanon; I cut down its tall cedar trees and its choicest cypress trees. I entered its most distant lodging, its densest forest.","19":"Now, O LORD our God, please, save us from his hand so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know [without any doubt] that You alone, O LORD, are God.\"","1":"When king Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes and he covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house (temple) of the LORD.","5":"So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.","4":"It may be that the LORD your God will hear all the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to taunt and defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard. So offer a prayer for the remnant [of His people] that is left [in Judah].\u0027\"","8":"So the Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah [a fortified city of Judah]; for he had heard that the king had left Lachish.","26":"\u0027Therefore their inhabitants were powerless, They were shattered [in spirit] and put to shame; They were like plants of the field, the green herb, As grass on the housetops is scorched before it is grown up.","14":"Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the house (temple) of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD.","37":"It came about as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with a sword; and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place.","22":"\u0027Whom have you taunted and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice, And haughtily lifted up your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel!","28":"\u0027Because of your raging against Me, And because your arrogance and complacency have come up to My ears, I will put My hook in your nose, And My bridle in your lips, And I will turn you back [to Assyria] by the way that you came.","25":"\u0027Have you not heard [asks the God of Israel]? Long ago I did it; From ancient times I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass, That you [king of Assyria] should [be My instrument to] turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps.","9":"When the king heard them say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, \"Behold, he has come out to make war against you,\" he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,","33":"By the way that he came, by the same way he will return, and he will not come into this city,\"\u0027 declares the LORD.","15":"Hezekiah prayed before the LORD and said, \"O LORD, the God of Israel, who is enthroned above the cherubim [of the ark in the temple], You are the God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made the heavens and the earth.","34":"For I will protect this city to save it, for My own sake and for My servant David\u0027s sake.\u0027\"","21":"This is the word that the LORD has spoken against him: \u0027The virgin daughter of Zion Has despised you and mocked you; The daughter of Jerusalem Has shaken her head behind you!","24":"\"I dug wells and drank foreign waters, And with the sole of my feet I dried up All the rivers of [the Lower Nile of] Egypt.\"","16":"O LORD, bend down Your ear and hear; LORD, open Your eyes and see; hear the [taunting] words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to taunt and defy the living God.","35":"Then it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went forth and struck down 185,000 [men] in the camp of the Assyrians; when the survivors got up early in the morning, behold, all [185,000] of them were dead.","32":"\u0027Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: \"He will not come to this city [Jerusalem] nor shoot an arrow there; nor will he come before it with a shield nor throw up a siege ramp against it.","7":"Behold, I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land. And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.\"\u0027\"","2":"Then he sent Eliakim who was in charge of his household, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.","6":"Isaiah said to them, \"Say this to your master: \u0027Thus says the LORD, \"Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have reviled (blasphemed) Me.","31":"For a remnant will go forth from Jerusalem, and [a band of] survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of the LORD of hosts shall perform this."},"13":{"16":"Then he said to the king of Israel, \"Put your hand on the bow.\" And he put his hand on it, and Elisha put his hands on the king\u0027s hands.","3":"So the anger of the LORD was kindled and burned against Israel, and He handed them over time and again to Hazael the king of Aram (Syria), and of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael.","5":"Then the LORD gave Israel a savior [to rescue them and give them peace], so that they escaped from under the hand of the Arameans; and the sons (descendants) of Israel lived in their tents as before.","21":"And it happened that as a man was being buried [on an open bier], they saw a marauding band [coming]; and they threw the man into Elisha\u0027s grave. But when the [body of the] man [was being let down and] touched the bones of Elisha he revived and stood up on his feet.","18":"Then he said, \"Take the arrows,\" and he took them. And Elisha said to the king of Israel, \"Strike the ground,\" and he struck it three times and stopped.","12":"Now the rest of the acts of Joash, everything that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?","10":"In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash (Joash) the son of Jehoahaz became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years.","2":"He did evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the [idolatrous] sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin; he did not turn from them.","22":"Hazael the king of Aram oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.","8":"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, everything that he did and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?","17":"And he said, \"Open the window to the east,\" and he opened it. Then Elisha said, \"Shoot!\" And he shot. And Elisha said, \"The Lord\u0027s arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Aram (Syria); for you will strike the Arameans in Aphek until you have destroyed them.\"","11":"He did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not turn away from all the [idolatrous] sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin; but he walked in them.","1":"In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned seventeen years.","9":"Jehoahaz slept with his fathers [in death], and they buried him in Samaria; Joash his son became king in his place.","24":"Hazael king of Aram (Syria) died; Ben-hadad his son became king in his place.","14":"Now Elisha had become sick with the illness by which he would die. And Joash the king of Israel came down to him and wept over him and said, \"O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!\"","7":"For he left to Jehoahaz [king of Israel] an army of no more than fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and 10,000 footmen, for the king of Aram (Ben-hadad) had destroyed them and made them like dust to be trampled.","15":"And Elisha said to him, \"Take a bow and arrows.\" So he took a bow and arrows.","20":"Elisha died, and they buried him. Now marauding bands of Moabites would invade the land in the spring of the year.","25":"Then Jehoash (Joash) the son of Jehoahaz recovered from Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken from Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times Joash defeated Ben-hadad and recovered the cities of Israel.","23":"But the LORD was gracious to them and had compassion on them and turned toward them for the sake of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and He was unwilling to destroy them, and did not cast them from His presence until now.","6":"Yet they did not turn from the [idolatrous] sins of the [royal] house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin; but walked in them. And the Asherah [set up by Ahab] also remained standing in Samaria [Israel\u0027s capital].","4":"But Jehoahaz sought the favor of the LORD, and the LORD listened to him; for He saw the oppression of Israel, how the king of Aram oppressed them.","19":"So the man of God was angry with him and said, \"You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck down Aram until you had destroyed it. But now you shall strike Aram only three times.\"","13":"Joash slept with his fathers [in death], and Jeroboam [II] sat on his throne. Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel."}}}
