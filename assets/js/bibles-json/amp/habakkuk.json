Even though it delays, wait [patiently] for it, Because it will certainly come; it will not delay.","5":"\"Moreover, wine is treacherous and betrays the arrogant man, So that he does not stay at home. His appetite is large like Sheol, And he is like death, never satisfied. He gathers to himself all nations And collects to himself all peoples [as if he owned them].","18":"\"What profit is the carved image when its maker has formed it? It is only a cast image, and a teacher of lies. For its maker trusts in his own creation [as his god] When he makes speechless idols.","12":"\"Woe (judgment is coming) to him who builds a city with bloodshed And establishes a town by violence!","10":"\"You have devised a shameful thing for your house By cutting off and putting an end to many peoples; So you are sinning against your own life and forfeiting it.","2":"Then the LORD answered me and said, \"Write the vision And engrave it plainly on [clay] tablets So that the one who reads it will run.","8":"\"Because you [king of Babylon] have looted many nations, All peoples who are left will loot you— Because of human bloodshed and for the violence done to the land, To the city and all its inhabitants.","17":"\"For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you; The destruction of the animals will terrify you On account of human bloodshed and the violence done to the land, To the city and all its inhabitants.","11":"\"For the stone will cry out from the wall [to accuse you—built in sin!] And the rafter will answer it out of the woodwork.","1":"I will stand at my guard post And station myself on the tower; And I will keep watch to see what He will say to me, And what answer I will give [as His spokesman] when I am reproved.","9":"\"Woe (judgment is coming) to him who obtains wicked gain for his house [and thinks by so doing] To set his nest on high, That he may be rescued from the hand of evil.","14":"\"But [the time is coming when] the earth shall be filled With the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, As the waters cover the sea.","7":"\"Will your creditors not rise up suddenly, And those who collect from you awaken?

For destruction and violence are before me; Strife continues and contention arises.","5":"[The LORD replied,] \"Look among the nations! See! Be astonished! Wonder! For I am doing something in your days— You would not believe it if you were told.","12":"Are You not from everlasting, O LORD, my God, My Holy One? We will not die. O LORD, You have appointed the Chaldeans [who rule in Babylon] to execute [Your] judgment, And You, O Rock, have established them to correct and chastise.","10":"\"They make fun of kings And rulers are a laughing matter to them. They ridicule every stronghold And heap up rubble [for earth mounds] and capture it.","2":"O LORD, how long will I call for help And You will not hear? I cry out to You, \"Violence!\" Yet You do not save.","8":"\"Their horses are swifter than leopards And keener than [hungry] wolves in the evening, Their horsemen come galloping, Their horsemen come from far away; They fly like an eagle swooping down to devour.","17":"Will they continue to empty their net And [mercilessly] go on destroying nations without sparing?","11":"\"Then they will sweep by like the wind and pass on. But they will be held guilty, They [and all men] whose own power and strength is their god.\"","1":"The oracle (a burdensome message—a pronouncement from God) which Habakkuk the prophet saw.","9":"\"They all come for violence; Their horde of faces moves [eagerly] forward, They gather prisoners like sand.","14":"Why do You make men like the fish of the sea, Like reptiles and creeping things that have no ruler [and are helpless against their enemies]?","7":"\"The Chaldeans are dreaded and feared; Their justice and authority originate with themselves and are defined only by their decree.","15":"The Chaldeans bring all of them up with a hook, And drag them away with a net, And gather them together in their fishing net; So they rejoice and are glad.","6":"\"For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans [who rule in Babylon], That fierce and impetuous nation Who march throughout the earth To take possession of dwelling places that do not belong to them.","4":"Therefore, the law is ineffective and ignored And justice is never upheld, For the wicked surround the righteous; Therefore, justice becomes perverted.","13":"Your eyes are too pure to approve evil, And You cannot look favorably on wickedness. Why then do You look favorably On those who act treacherously? Why are you silent when the wicked (Chaldean oppressors) destroy Those more righteous than they?"},"3":{"16":"I heard and my whole inner self trembled; My lips quivered at the sound.

O LORD, revive Your work in the midst of the years, In the midst of the years make it known; In wrath [earnestly] remember compassion and love.","8":"Did the LORD rage against the rivers, Or was Your anger against the rivers, Or was Your wrath against the [Red] Sea, That You rode on Your horses, On Your chariots of salvation?","17":"Though the fig tree does not blossom And there is no fruit on the vines, Though the yield of the olive fails And the fields produce no food, Though the flock is cut off from the fold And there are no cattle in the stalls,","11":"The sun and moon stood in their places [as before Joshua]; They went away at the light of Your [swift] arrows, At the radiance and gleam of Your glittering spear.","1":"A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, set to wild and enthusiastic music.","9":"Your bow was made bare; The rods of chastisement were sworn. Selah (pause, calmly think of that). You split the earth with rivers [bringing waters to dry places].","14":"With the enemy\u0027s own spears, You pierced The head of his hordes. They stormed out to scatter us, Rejoicing like those Who secretly devour the oppressed [of Israel].","7":"I [Habakkuk, in my vision] saw the tents of Cushan under distress; The tent curtains of the land of Midian were trembling.","15":"You have trampled on the sea with Your horses, On the surge of many waters.","6":"He stood and measured the earth; He looked and startled the nations, Yes, the eternal mountains were shattered, The ancient hills bowed low and collapsed. His ways are eternal.","4":"His brightness is like the sunlight; He has [bright] rays flashing from His hand, And there [in the sunlike splendor] is the hiding place of His power.","19":"The Lord GOD is my strength [my source of courage, my invincible army]; He has made my feet [steady and sure] like hinds\u0027 feet And makes me walk [forward with spiritual confidence] on my high places [of challenge and responsibility]. For the choir director, on my stringed instruments.","13":"You went forth for the salvation of Your people, For the salvation and rescue of Your anointed [people Israel]. You struck the head from the house of the wicked To lay him open from the thigh to the neck. Selah (pause, and calmly think of that)."}}}
