So the people without understanding [stumble and fall and] come to ruin.","7":"The more they multiplied [in numbers and increased in power], the more they sinned against Me; I will change their glory into shame.","15":"Though you, Israel, play the prostitute [by worshiping idols], Do not let Judah become guilty [of the same thing]; And do not go to Gilgal [where idols are worshiped], Or go up to Beth-aven (House of Wickedness), Nor swear [oaths in idolatrous worship, saying], \"As the LORD lives!\"","6":"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge [of My law, where I reveal My will]. Because you [the priestly nation] have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you from being My priest. Since you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget your children.","4":"Yet let no one find fault, nor let any rebuke [others]; For your people are like those who contend with the priest.","19":"The wind [of God\u0027s relentless wrath] has wrapped up Israel in its wings, And [in captivity] they will be ashamed because of their sacrifices [to calves, to sun, to moon, to stars, and to pagan gods].","13":"They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains And burn incense on the hills, Under oaks, poplars, and terebinths, Because the shade is pleasant there. Therefore your daughters play the prostitute And your brides commit adultery."},"13":{"16":"Samaria will be found guilty [and become desolate], Because she rebelled against her God; They will fall by the sword, Their infants will be dashed in pieces, And their pregnant women will be ripped open.","3":"Therefore they will be [swiftly dissipated] like the morning cloud Or like dew which soon disappears, Like chaff which swirls with the whirlwind from the threshing floor, And like smoke from the chimney or through the window [worthless and without substance —they will vanish].","5":"I knew and regarded you and cared for you in the wilderness, In the land of drought.","12":"The wickedness of Ephraim [which is not yet completely punished] is bound up [as in a bag]; His sin is stored up [for judgment and destruction].","10":"Where now is your king That he may save you [when you are attacked] in all your cities? And your judges of whom you asked, \"Give me a king and princes\"?","2":"And now they sin more and more, And make for themselves molten images, Idols skillfully made from their silver [as it pleased them], All of them the work of the craftsmen. They say of these [very works of their hands], \"Let those who sacrifice kiss and show respect to the calves [as if they were living gods]!\"","8":"I will encounter them like a bear robbed of her cubs, And I will tear open their chests; There I will also devour them like a lioness, As a wild beast would tear them.","11":"I gave you a king in My anger, And I took him away in My wrath [as punishment].","1":"When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling and terror. He exalted himself [above the other tribes] in Israel; But through [the worship of] Baal he became guilty and died [spiritually, and then came ruin, sealing Israel\u0027s doom as a nation].","9":"It is your destruction, O Israel, Because you are against Me, [and have rebelled] against your help.","14":"Shall I ransom them from the power of Sheol (the place of the dead)? Shall I redeem them from death?  O death, where are your thorns? O Sheol, where is your sting? Compassion is hidden from My eyes [because of their failure to repent].","7":"So I will be like a lion to them; Like a leopard I will watch and lie in wait [ready to attack] by the road [to Assyria].","15":"For though he flourishes among the reeds (his fellow tribes), An east wind (Assyria) will come, The breath of the LORD rising from the desert; And Ephraim\u0027s spring will become dry And his fountain will be dried up. Assyria will plunder his treasury of every precious object.","6":"When they had their pasture, they became satisfied, And being satisfied, their heart became proud (self-centered); Therefore they forgot Me.","4":"Yet I have been the LORD your God Since [the time you became a nation in] the land of Egypt; And you were not to know any god except Me, For there is no savior besides Me.","13":"The pains of childbirth come on him; But he is not a wise son, For it is not the time to delay [his chance at a new birth] as the womb opens [but he ignores the opportunity to change]."}}}
