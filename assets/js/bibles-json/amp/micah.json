They shall put their hand on their mouth [in silent astonishment]; Their ears shall be deaf.","3":"Concerning evil, both of their hands pursue it and do it diligently and thoroughly; The prince asks, also the judge, for a bribe, And a great man speaks the [evil] desire of his soul. So they twist the course of justice between them.","5":"Do not trust in a neighbor [because of the moral corruption in the land]; Do not have confidence in a friend. Guard the doors of your mouth From her who lies in your bosom.","18":"Who is a God like You, who forgives wickedness And passes over the rebellious acts of the remnant of His possession? He does not retain His anger forever, Because He [constantly] delights in mercy and lovingkindness.","12":"It shall be a day when the Gentiles will come to you From Assyria and from the cities of Egypt, And from Egypt even to the river Euphrates, From sea to sea and from mountain to mountain.","10":"Then my enemy [all the pagan nations] shall see it, And shame [for despising the LORD] will cover her who said to me, \"Where is the LORD your God?\" My eyes will look on her [with satisfaction at her judgment]; Now she (unbelievers) will be trampled down Like mud of the streets.","2":"The godly person [who is faithful and loyal to God] has perished from the earth, And there is no upright person [one with good character and moral integrity] among men. They all lie in wait to shed blood; Each hunts the other with a net.","8":"Do not rejoice over me [amid my tragedies], O my enemy! Though I fall, I will rise; Though I sit in the darkness [of distress], the LORD is a light for me.","17":"They shall lick the dust like a serpent; Like crawling things of the earth They shall come trembling out of their fortresses and hiding places. They shall turn and come with fear and dread to the LORD our God And they shall be afraid and stand in awe before You [O LORD].","11":"It shall be a day for building your walls, On that day the boundary [of Israel] shall be [greatly] extended.","1":"Woe is me (judgment is coming)! For I am Like one who gathers the summer fruits, like one who gleans the vintage grapes. There is not a cluster of grapes to eat, No first-ripe fig which my appetite craves.","9":"I will bear the indignation and wrath of the LORD Because I have sinned against Him, Until He pleads my case and executes judgment for me. He will bring me out to the light, And I will behold His [amazing] righteousness and His remarkable deliverance.","14":"Shepherd and rule Your people with Your scepter [of blessing], The flock of Your inheritance and Your possession Which dwells alone [separate and secure from attack] in the forest, In the midst of a garden land. Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead As in the days of old [the days of Moses and Elijah].","7":"But as for me, I will look expectantly for the LORD and with confidence in Him I will keep watch; I will wait [with confident expectation] for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me.","15":"\"As in the days when you came out from the land of Egypt, I shall show you marvelous and miraculous things.\"","20":"You shall give truth to Jacob And lovingkindness and mercy to Abraham, As You have sworn to our forefathers From the days of old.","6":"For the son dishonors the father and treats him contemptuously, The daughter rises up [in hostility] against her mother, The daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law— A man\u0027s enemies are the men (members) of his own household.","4":"The best of them is [injurious] like a briar; The most upright is [prickly] like a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen [that is, the time predicted by the prophets] And your punishment comes; Now shall be their confusion.","19":"He shall again have compassion on us; He will subdue and tread underfoot our wickedness [destroying sin\u0027s power]. Yes, You will cast all our sins Into the depths of the sea.","13":"Yet the earth [beyond the land of Israel] shall become desolate because of those who dwell in it, Because of the fruit of their deeds."},"3":{"7":"The seers shall be ashamed And the diviners discredited and embarrassed; Indeed, they shall all cover their mouths [in shame] Because there is no answer from God.","9":"Now hear this, you heads of the house of Jacob And rulers of the house of Israel, Who hate and reject justice And twist everything that is straight,","10":"Who build Zion with blood [and extortion and murder] And Jerusalem with violent injustice.","3":"You who eat the flesh of my people, Strip off their skin from them, Break their bones And chop them in pieces as for the pot, Like meat in a kettle.\"","11":"Her leaders pronounce judgment for a bribe, Her priests teach for a fee, And her prophets foretell for money; Yet they lean on the LORD, saying, \"Is not the LORD among us? No tragedy or distress will come on us.\"","2":"\"You who hate good and love evil, Who tear the skin off my people And their flesh from their bones;","1":"And I said, \"Hear now, heads of Jacob And rulers of the house of Israel. Is it not for you to know and administer justice?","12":"Therefore, on account of you  Zion shall be plowed like a field, Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, And the mountain of the house [of the LORD] shall become like a densely wooded hill.","4":"Then they will cry to the LORD, But He will not answer them; Instead, He will even hide His face from them at that time [withholding His mercy] Because they have practiced and tolerated and ignored evil acts.","6":"Therefore it will be night (tragedy) for you—without vision, And darkness (cataclysm) for you—without foresight. The sun shall go down on the [false] prophets, And the day shall become dark and black over them.","5":"Thus says the LORD concerning the [false] prophets who lead my people astray; When they have something good to bite with their teeth, They call out, \"Peace,\" But against the one who gives them nothing to eat, They declare a holy war.","8":"But in fact, I am filled with power, With the Spirit of the LORD, And with justice and might, To declare to Jacob his transgression And to Israel his sin."},"2":{"3":"Therefore, thus says the LORD, \"Behold, I am planning against this family a disaster (exile) [Like a noose] from which you cannot remove your necks; Nor will you be able to walk haughtily and erect, For it will be an evil time [of subjugation to the invaders].","5":"\"Therefore, you will have no one stretching a measuring line [dividing the common land] For you by lot in the assembly of the LORD.","12":"\"I shall most certainly assemble all of you, O Jacob; I shall surely gather the remnant of Israel. I shall bring them together like sheep in the fold [multiplying the nation]; Like a flock in the midst of its pasture. The place will swarm with many people and hum loudly with noise.","10":"\"Arise and depart [because the captivity is inevitable], For this [land] is not the place of rest Because of the defilement that brings destruction, A painful and terrible destruction.","2":"They covet fields and seize them, And houses, and take them away. They oppress and rob a man and his house, A man and his inheritance.","8":"\"But lately My people have stood up as an enemy [and have made Me their antagonist]. You strip the ornaments off the garment Of those unsuspecting passers-by, Like those returned from war.","11":"\"If a man walking in a false spirit [spouting deception] Should lie and say, \u0027I will prophesy to you [O Israel] of wine and liquor (greed, sensual pleasure),\u0027 He would be the acceptable spokesman of this people.","1":"Woe (judgment is coming) to those who devise wickedness And plot evil on their beds! When morning comes, they practice evil Because it is in the power of their hands.","9":"\"You evict the women (widows) of My people, Each one from her pleasant house; From her [young, fatherless] children you take away My splendor and blessing forever [by putting them among the pagans, away from Me].","7":"\"Is it being said, O house of Jacob: \u0027Is the Spirit of the LORD impatient? Or are these [prophesied judgments] His doings?\u0027 Do not My words do good To the one walking uprightly?","6":"\u0027Do not speak out,\u0027 so they speak out. But if they do not speak out concerning these things, Reproaches will not be turned back.","4":"\"On that day they shall take up a [taunting, deriding] parable against you And wail with a doleful and bitter song of mourning and say, \u0027We are completely destroyed! God exchanges the inheritance of my people; How He removes it from me! He divides our fields to the rebellious [our captors].\u0027","13":"\"The breaker [the Messiah, who opens the way] shall go up before them [liberating them]. They will break out, pass through the gate and go out; So their King goes on before them, The LORD at their head.\""},"1":{"16":"Make yourself bald [in mourning]—shave off your hair For the children of your delight; Remain as bald as the eagle, For your children will be taken from you into exile.","3":"For behold, the LORD is coming down from His place He shall come down and tread [in judgment] on the high places of the earth.","5":"All this is because of the rebellion and apostasy of Jacob And for the sins of the house of Israel (the Northern Kingdom). What is the rebellion and apostasy of Jacob? Is it not [the abandonment of God in order to worship the idols of] Samaria? What are the high places [of idolatry] in Judah (the Southern Kingdom)? Are they not Jerusalem [the capital and center of corruption]?","12":"For the inhabitant of Maroth (Bitterness) Writhes in pain [at its losses] and waits anxiously for good, Because a catastrophe has come down from the LORD To the gate of Jerusalem.","10":"Announce it not in Gath [in Philistia], Weep not at all [and in this way betray your grief to Gentiles]; In Beth-le-aphrah (House of Dust) roll in the dust [among your own people].","2":"Hear, O peoples, all of you; Listen closely, O earth and all that is in it, And let the Lord GOD be witness [giving a testimony of the judgment] against you, The Lord from His holy temple [in the heavens].","8":"Because of this I [Micah] must lament (mourn over with expressions of grief) and wail, I must go barefoot and naked [without outer garments as if robbed]; I must wail like the jackals And lament [with a loud, mournful cry] like the ostriches.","11":"Go on your way [into exile—stripped of beauty, disarmed], inhabitants of Shaphir (Beautiful), in shameful nakedness. The inhabitant of Zaanan (Go Out) does not go out [of the house]; The wailing of Beth-ezel (House of Removal) will take away from you its support.","1":"The word of the LORD that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw [through divine revelation] concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.","9":"For Samaria\u0027s wound is incurable, For it has come to Judah; The enemy has reached the gate of my people, Even to Jerusalem.","14":"Therefore you will give parting gifts On behalf of Moresheth-gath (Micah\u0027s home); The houses of Achzib (Place of Deceit) will become a deception To the kings of Israel.","7":"All her idols shall be broken in pieces, All her earnings [from her idolatry] shall be burned with fire, And all her images I shall make desolate; For from the earnings of a prostitute she collected them, And to the earnings of a prostitute they shall return.","15":"Moreover, I will bring on you The one who takes possession, O inhabitant of Mareshah (Prominent Place). The glory (nobility) of Israel will enter Adullam [seeking refuge].","6":"Therefore I [the LORD] shall make Samaria a heap of ruins [and of stones and arable land] in the open country, A place for planting vineyards; And I will pour her stones down into the ravine And lay bare her foundations.","4":"The mountains shall melt under Him And the valleys shall be split Like wax before the fire, Like waters poured down a steep place.","13":"Harness the chariot to the team of horses [to escape the invasion], O inhabitant of Lachish— She was the beginning of sin To the Daughter of Zion (Jerusalem)— Because in you were found The rebellious acts of Israel."},"4":{"3":"And He will judge between many peoples And render decisions for strong and distant nations.

There you will be rescued; There the LORD shall redeem you From the hand of your enemies.","2":"And many nations shall come and say, \"Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, To the house of the God of Jacob, That He may teach us about His ways And that we may walk in His paths.\" For the law shall go forward from Zion, And the word of the LORD [the revelation about Him and His truth] from Jerusalem.","8":"\"As for you [Jerusalem], tower of the flock [of Israel], Hill and stronghold of the Daughter of Zion (Jerusalem\u0027s inhabitants), To you the former dominion shall come, The kingdom of the Daughter of Jerusalem [when the Messiah reigns in Jerusalem, and the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled].","11":"\"Now many [conquering] nations are assembled against you, Who say, \u0027Let her be profaned [through Gentile presence and the temple\u0027s destruction], And let our eyes gaze on and gloat over Zion.\u0027","1":"But it shall come about in the last days That the mountain of the house of the LORD Shall be established as the highest and chief of the mountains; It shall be above the hills, And peoples shall flow [like a river] to it.","9":"\"Now, why do you cry out loudly?
