Was it I who brought them forth, that You should say to me, \u0027Carry them in your arms as a nurse carries the nursing infant, to the land which You swore to their fathers\u0027?","10":"Now Moses heard the people weeping [in self-pity] throughout their families, every man at the doorway of his tent; and the anger of the LORD blazed hotly, and Moses regarded their behavior as evil.","17":"Then I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take away some of the Spirit who is upon you, and will put Him upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you will not have to bear it all alone.","13":"Where am I to get meat to give to all these people? For they weep before me and say, \u0027Give us meat, so that we may eat.\u0027","27":"So a young man ran and told Moses and said, \"Eldad and Medad are prophesying [extolling the praises of God and declaring His will] in the camp.\"","30":"Then Moses went back into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.","18":"Say to the people, \u0027Consecrate (separate as holy) yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wept [in self-pity] in the ears of the LORD, saying, \"Who will give us meat to eat?

The Spirit rested upon them (now they were among those who had been registered, but had not gone out to the Tent), and they prophesied in the camp.","14":"I am not able to carry all these people alone, because the burden is too heavy for me.","22":"Should flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them?
