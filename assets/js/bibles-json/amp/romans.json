If some did not believe or were unfaithful [to God], their lack of belief will not nullify and make invalid the faithfulness of God and His word, will it?","20":"For no person will be justified [freed of guilt and declared righteous] in His sight by [trying to do] the works of the Law. For through the Law we become conscious of sin [and the recognition of sin directs us toward repentance, but provides no remedy for sin].","12":"\"All have turned aside, together they have become useless; There is none who does good, no, not one.\"","10":"As it is written and forever remains written, \"There is none righteous [none that meets God\u0027s standard], not even one.","17":"And they have not known the path of peace.\"","13":"\"Their throat is an open grave; They [habitually] deceive with their tongues.\" \"The venom of asps is beneath their lips.\"","27":"Then what becomes of [our] boasting?

No, but on the principle of faith.","30":"since indeed it is one [and the same] God who will justify the circumcised by faith [which began with Abraham] and the uncircumcised through [their newly acquired] faith.","18":"\"There is no fear of God [and His awesome power] before their eyes.\"","29":"Or is God the God of Jews only? Is He not also the God of Gentiles [who were not given the Law]? Yes, of Gentiles also,","23":"since all have sinned and continually fall short of the glory of God,","19":"Now we know that whatever the Law [of Moses] says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that [the excuses of] every mouth may be silenced [from protesting] and that all the world may be held accountable to God [and subject to His judgment].","1":"Then what is the advantage of the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision?","5":"But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? God is not wrong to inflict His wrath [on us], is He?

Let God be found true [as He will be], though every person be found a liar, just as it is written [in Scripture], \"That You may be justified in Your words, And prevail when You are judged [by sinful men].\"","8":"And why not say, (as some slanderously report and claim that we teach) \"Let us do evil so that good may come of it\"?

Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks (Gentiles) are under the control of sin and subject to its power.","15":"\"Their feet are swift to shed blood,","21":"But now the righteousness of God has been clearly revealed [independently and completely] apart from the Law, though it is [actually] confirmed by the Law and the [words and writings of the] Prophets.","24":"and are being justified [declared free of the guilt of sin, made acceptable to God, and granted eternal life] as a gift by His [precious, undeserved] grace, through the redemption [the payment for our sin] which is [provided] in Christ Jesus,","16":"Destruction and misery are in their paths,","7":"But [as you might say] if through my lie God\u0027s truth was magnified and abounded to His glory, why am I still being judged as a sinner?","2":"Great in every respect.

For otherwise, how will God judge the world?","31":"Do we then nullify the Law by this faith [making the Law of no effect, overthrowing it]? Certainly not! On the contrary, we confirm and establish and uphold the Law [since it convicts us all of sin, pointing to the need for salvation]."},"5":{"16":"Nor is the gift [of grace] like that which came through the one who sinned. For on the one hand the judgment [following the sin] resulted from one trespass and brought condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift resulted from many trespasses and brought justification [the release from sin\u0027s penalty for those who believe].","3":"And not only this, but [with joy] let us exult in our sufferings and rejoice in our hardships, knowing that hardship (distress, pressure, trouble) produces patient endurance;","5":"Such hope [in God\u0027s promises] never disappoints us, because God\u0027s love has been abundantly poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.","21":"so that, as sin reigned in death, so also grace would reign through righteousness which brings eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.","18":"So then as through one trespass [Adam\u0027s sin] there resulted condemnation for all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men.","12":"Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, so death spread to all people [no one being able to stop it or escape its power], because they all sinned.","10":"For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, it is much more certain, having been reconciled, that we will be saved [from the consequences of sin] by His life [that is, we will be saved because Christ lives today].","2":"Through Him we also have access by faith into this [remarkable state of] grace in which we [firmly and safely and securely] stand. Let us rejoice in our hope and the confident assurance of [experiencing and enjoying] the glory of [our great] God [the manifestation of His excellence and power].","8":"But God clearly shows and proves His own love for us, by the fact that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.","17":"For if by the trespass of the one (Adam), death reigned through the one (Adam), much more surely will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in [eternal] life through the One, Jesus Christ.","11":"Not only that, but we also rejoice in God [rejoicing in His love and perfection] through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received and enjoy our reconciliation [with God].","1":"Therefore, since we have been justified [that is, acquitted of sin, declared blameless before God] by faith, [let us grasp the fact that] we have peace with God [and the joy of reconciliation with Him] through our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed).","9":"Therefore, since we have now been justified [declared free of the guilt of sin] by His blood, [how much more certain is it that] we will be saved from the wrath of God through Him.","14":"Yet death ruled [over mankind] from Adam to Moses [the Lawgiver], even over those who had not sinned as Adam did. Adam is a type of Him (Christ) who was to come [but in reverse—Adam brought destruction, Christ brought salvation].","7":"Now it is an extraordinary thing for one to willingly give his life even for an upright man, though perhaps for a good man [one who is noble and selfless and worthy] someone might even dare to die.","15":"But the free gift [of God] is not like the trespass [because the gift of grace overwhelms the fall of man]. For if many died by one man\u0027s trespass [Adam\u0027s sin], much more [abundantly] did God\u0027s grace and the gift [that comes] by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, overflow to [benefit] the many.","20":"But the Law came to increase and expand [the awareness of] the trespass [by defining and unmasking sin]. But where sin increased, [God\u0027s remarkable, gracious gift of] grace [His unmerited favor] has surpassed it and increased all the more,","6":"While we were still helpless [powerless to provide for our salvation], at the right time Christ died [as a substitute] for the ungodly.","4":"and endurance, proven character (spiritual maturity); and proven character, hope and confident assurance [of eternal salvation].","19":"For just as through one man\u0027s disobedience [his failure to hear, his carelessness] the many were made sinners, so through the obedience of the one Man the many will be made righteous and acceptable to God and brought into right standing with Him.","13":"Sin was [committed] in the world before the Law [was given], but sin is not charged [against anyone] when there is no law [against it]."},"12":{"16":"Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty [conceited, self-important, exclusive], but associate with humble people [those with a realistic self-view]. Do not overestimate yourself.","3":"For by the grace [of God] given to me I say to everyone of you not to think more highly of himself [and of his importance and ability] than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has apportioned to each a degree of faith [and a purpose designed for service].","5":"so we, who are many, are [nevertheless just] one body in Christ, and individually [we are] parts one of another [mutually dependent on each other].","21":"Do not be overcome and conquered by evil, but overcome evil with good.","18":"If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.","12":"constantly rejoicing in hope [because of our confidence in Christ], steadfast and patient in distress, devoted to prayer [continually seeking wisdom, guidance, and strength],","10":"Be devoted to one another with [authentic] brotherly affection [as members of one family], give preference to one another in honor;","2":"And do not be conformed to this world [any longer with its superficial values and customs], but be transformed and progressively changed [as you mature spiritually] by the renewing of your mind [focusing on godly values and ethical attitudes], so that you may prove [for yourselves] what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect [in His plan and purpose for you].","8":"or he who encourages, in the act of encouragement; he who gives, with generosity; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy [in caring for others], with cheerfulness.","17":"Never repay anyone evil for evil.

Indeed they have; \"Their voice [that of creation bearing God\u0027s message] has gone out to all the earth, And their words to the [farthest] ends of the world.\"","12":"For there is no distinction between Jew and Gentile; for the same Lord is Lord over all [of us], and [He is] abounding in riches (blessings) for all who call on Him [in faith and prayer].","10":"For with the heart a person believes [in Christ as Savior] resulting in his justification [that is, being made righteous—being freed of the guilt of sin and made acceptable to God]; and with the mouth he acknowledges and confesses [his faith openly], resulting in and confirming [his] salvation.","2":"For I testify about them that they have a certain enthusiasm for God, but not in accordance with [correct and vital] knowledge [about Him and His purposes].","8":"But what does it say? \"The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart\"—that is, the word [the message, the basis] of faith which we preach—","17":"So faith comes from hearing [what is told], and what is heard comes by the [preaching of the] message concerning Christ.","11":"For the Scripture says, \"Whoever believes in Him [whoever adheres to, trusts in, and relies on Him] will not be disappointed [in his expectations].\"","1":"Brothers and sisters, my heart\u0027s desire and my prayer to God for Israel is for their salvation.","9":"because if you acknowledge and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord [recognizing His power, authority, and majesty as God], and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.","14":"But how will people call on Him in whom they have not believed?

You who detest idols, do you rob [pagan] temples [of valuable idols and offerings]?","28":"For he is not a [real] Jew who is only one outwardly, nor is [true] circumcision something external and physical.","25":"Circumcision [the sign of the covenant of Abraham] is indeed of value if you practice the Law; but if you habitually break the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision [it is meaningless in God\u0027s sight].","9":"There will be tribulation and anguish [torturing confinement] for every human soul who does [or permits] evil, to the Jew first and also to the Greek,","15":"They show that the essential requirements of the Law are written in their hearts; and their conscience [their sense of right and wrong, their moral choices] bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or perhaps defending them","21":"well then, you who teach others, do you not teach yourself?

Should we continue in sin and practice sin as a habit so that [God\u0027s gift of] grace may increase and overflow?","9":"because we know [the self-evident truth] that Christ, having been raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has power over Him.","14":"For sin will no longer be a master over you, since you are not under Law [as slaves], but under [unmerited] grace [as recipients of God\u0027s favor and mercy].","7":"For the person who has died [with Christ] has been freed from [the power of] sin.","15":"What then [are we to conclude]? Shall we sin because we are not under Law, but under [God\u0027s] grace? Certainly not!","20":"When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness [you had no desire to conform to God\u0027s will].","23":"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God [that is, His remarkable, overwhelming gift of grace to believers] is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.","6":"We know that our old self [our human nature without the Holy Spirit] was nailed to the cross with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin.","4":"We have therefore been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory and power of the Father, we too might walk habitually in newness of life [abandoning our old ways].","19":"I am speaking in [familiar] human terms because of your natural limitations [your spiritual immaturity]. For just as you presented your bodily members as slaves to impurity and to [moral] lawlessness, leading to further lawlessness, so now offer your members [your abilities, your talents] as slaves to righteousness, leading to sanctification [that is, being set apart for God\u0027s purpose].","13":"Do not go on offering members of your body to sin as instruments of wickedness. But offer yourselves to God [in a decisive act] as those alive [raised] from the dead [to a new life], and your members [all of your abilities—sanctified, set apart] as instruments of righteousness [yielded] to God."},"4":{"16":"Therefore, [inheriting] the promise depends entirely on faith [that is, confident trust in the unseen God], in order that it may be given as an act of grace [His unmerited favor and mercy], so that the promise will be [legally] guaranteed to all the descendants [of Abraham]—not only for those [Jewish believers] who keep the Law, but also for those [Gentile believers] who share the faith of Abraham, who is the [spiritual] father of us all—","3":"For what does the Scripture say? \"Abraham believed in (trusted, relied on) God, and it was credited to his account as righteousness (right living, right standing with God).\"","5":"But to the one who does not work [that is, the one who does not try to earn his salvation by doing good], but believes and completely trusts in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited to him as righteousness (right standing with God).","21":"being fully convinced that God had the power to do what He had promised.","18":"In hope against hope Abraham believed that he would become a father of many nations, as he had been promised [by God]: \"So [numberless] shall your descendants be.\"","12":"and [that he would be] the [spiritual] father of those circumcised who are not only circumcised, but who also walk in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had before he was circumcised.","10":"How then was it credited [to him]? Was it after he had been circumcised, or before? Not after, but while [he was] uncircumcised.","2":"For if Abraham was justified [that is, acquitted from the guilt of his sins] by works [those things he did that were good], he has something to boast about, but not before God.","22":"Therefore his faith was credited to him as righteousness (right standing with God).","8":"\"Blessed and happy and favored is the man whose sin the Lord will not take into account nor charge against him.\"","17":"(as it is written [in Scripture], \"I have made you a father of many nations\") in the sight of Him in whom he believed, that is, God who gives life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist.","11":"He received the sign of circumcision, a seal or confirmation of the righteousness which he had by faith while [he was still] uncircumcised—this was so that he would be the [spiritual] father of all who believe without being circumcised—so that righteousness would be credited to them,","1":"What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather humanly speaking, has found? [Has he obtained a favored standing?]","9":"Is this blessing only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say, \"Faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.\"","24":"but for our sake also—to whom righteousness will be credited, as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead—","14":"If those who are [followers] of the Law are [the true] heirs [of Abraham], then faith [leading to salvation] is of no effect and void, and the promise [of God] is nullified.","7":"\"Blessed and happy and favored are those whose lawless acts have been forgiven, And whose sins have been covered up and completely buried.","15":"For the Law results in [God\u0027s] wrath [against sin], but where there is no law, there is no violation [of it either].","20":"But he did not doubt or waver in unbelief concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong and empowered by faith, giving glory to God,","25":"who was betrayed and crucified because of our sins, and was raised [from the dead] because of our justification [our acquittal—absolving us of all sin before God].","23":"Now not for his sake alone was it written that it was credited to him,","6":"And in this same way David speaks of the blessing on the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:","4":"Now to a laborer, his wages are not credited as a favor or a gift, but as an obligation [something owed to him].","19":"Without becoming weak in faith he considered his own body, now as good as dead [for producing children] since he was about a hundred years old, and [he considered] the deadness of Sarah\u0027s womb.","13":"For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through [observing the requirements of] the Law, but through the righteousness of faith."},"13":{"3":"For [civil] authorities are not a source of fear for [people of] good behavior, but for [those who do] evil. Do you want to be unafraid of authority? Do what is good and you will receive approval and commendation.","5":"Therefore one must be subject [to civil authorities], not only to escape the punishment [that comes with wrongdoing], but also as a matter of principle [knowing what is right before God].","12":"The night [this present evil age] is almost gone and the day [of Christ\u0027s return] is almost here. So let us fling away the works of darkness and put on the [full] armor of light.","10":"Love does no wrong to a neighbor [it never hurts anyone]. Therefore [unselfish] love is the fulfillment of the Law.","2":"Therefore whoever resists [governmental] authority resists the ordinance of God. And those who have resisted it will bring judgment (civil penalty) on themselves.","8":"Owe nothing to anyone except to love and seek the best for one another; for he who [unselfishly] loves his neighbor has fulfilled the [essence of the] law [relating to one\u0027s fellowman].","11":"Do this, knowing that this is a critical time. It is already the hour for you to awaken from your sleep [of spiritual complacency]; for our salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed [in Christ].","1":"Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God [granted by His permission and sanction], and those which exist have been put in place by God.","9":"The commandments, \"You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet,\" and any other commandment are summed up in this statement: \"You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\"","14":"But clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for [nor even think about gratifying] the flesh in regard to its improper desires.","7":"Pay to all what is due: tax to whom tax is due, customs to whom customs, respect to whom respect, honor to whom honor.","6":"For this same reason you pay taxes, for civil authorities are God\u0027s servants, devoting themselves to governance.","4":"For he is God\u0027s servant to you for good. But if you do wrong, [you should] be afraid; for he does not carry the [executioner\u0027s] sword for nothing. He is God\u0027s servant, an avenger who brings punishment on the wrongdoer.","13":"Let us conduct ourselves properly and honorably as in the [light of] day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and irresponsibility, not in quarreling and jealousy."}}}
