Tell me, what do you have in the house?\u0027 And she said, \u0027Your maidservant has nothing in the house except a jar of oil.\u0027","38":"When Elisha returned to Gilgal, [there was] a famine in the land. As the sons of the prophets were sitting before him, he said to his servant, \u0027Put on the large pot and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.\u0027","6":"When the vessels were full, she said to her son, \u0027Bring me another vessel.\u0027 And he said to her, \u0027There is not one vessel more.\u0027 And the oil stopped.","31":"Then Gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff on the lad\u0027s face, but there was no sound or response.
