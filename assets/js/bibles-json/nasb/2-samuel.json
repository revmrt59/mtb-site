Was it not our advice first to bring back our king?\u0027 Yet the words of the men of Judah were harsher than the words of the men of Israel.","2":"The victory that day was turned to mourning for all the people, for the people heard [it] said that day, \u0027The king is grieved for his son.\u0027","38":"The king answered, \u0027Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him what is good in your sight; and whatever you require of me, I will do for you.\u0027","6":"by loving those who hate you, and by hating those who love you. For you have shown today that princes and servants are nothing to you; for I know this day that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, then you would be pleased.","31":"Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim; and he went on to the Jordan with the king to escort him over the Jordan."},"13":{"11":"When she brought [them] to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, \u0027Come, lie with me, my sister.\u0027","3":"But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David\u0027s brother; and Jonadab was a very shrewd man.","20":"Then Absalom her brother said to her, \u0027Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now keep silent, my sister, he is your brother; do not take this matter to heart.\u0027 So Tamar remained and was desolate in her brother Absalom\u0027s house.","12":"But she answered him, \u0027No, my brother, do not violate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this disgraceful thing!","10":"Then Amnon said to Tamar, \u0027Bring the food into the bedroom, that I may eat from your hand.\u0027 So Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the bedroom to her brother Amnon.","17":"Then he called his young man who attended him and said, \u0027Now throw this woman out of my [presence], and lock the door behind her.\u0027","13":"\u0027As for me, where could I get rid of my reproach? And as for you, you will be like one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.\u0027","27":"But when Absalom urged him, he let Amnon and all the king\u0027s sons go with him.","30":"Now it was while they were on the way that the report came to David, saying, \u0027Absalom has struck down all the king\u0027s sons, and not one of them is left.\u0027","18":"Now she had on a long-sleeved garment; for in this manner the virgin daughters of the king dressed themselves in robes. Then his attendant took her out and locked the door behind her.","36":"As soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king\u0027s sons came and lifted their voices and wept; and also the king and all his servants wept very bitterly.","29":"The servants of Absalom did to Amnon just as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king\u0027s sons arose and each mounted his mule and fled.","23":"Now it came about after two full years that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king\u0027s sons.","19":"Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her long-sleeved garment which [was] on her; and she put her hand on her head and went away, crying aloud as she went.","1":"Now it was after this that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar, and Amnon the son of David loved her.","5":"Jonadab then said to him, \u0027Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill; when your father comes to see you, say to him, \u0027Please let my sister Tamar come and give me [some] food to eat, and let her prepare the food in my sight, that I may see [it] and eat from her hand.\u0027\u0027","4":"He said to him, \u0027O son of the king, why are you so depressed morning after morning? Will you not tell me?\u0027 Then Amnon said to him, \u0027I am in love with Tamar, the sister of my brother Absalom.\u0027","8":"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon\u0027s house, and he was lying down. And she took dough, kneaded [it], made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.","26":"Then Absalom said, \u0027If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.\u0027 And the king said to him, \u0027Why should he go with you?\u0027","39":"[The heart of] King David longed to go out to Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead.","14":"However, he would not listen to her; since he was stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her.","37":"Now Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day.","22":"But Absalom did not speak to Amnon either good or bad; for Absalom hated Amnon because he had violated his sister Tamar.","28":"Absalom commanded his servants, saying, \u0027See now, when Amnon\u0027s heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, \u0027Strike Amnon,\u0027 then put him to death. Do not fear; have not I myself commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant.\u0027","25":"But the king said to Absalom, \u0027No, my son, we should not all go, for we will be burdensome to you.\u0027 Although he urged him, he would not go, but blessed him.","9":"She took the pan and dished [them] out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, \u0027Have everyone go out from me.\u0027 So everyone went out from him.","33":"\u0027Now therefore, do not let my lord the king take the report to heart, namely, \u0027all the king\u0027s sons are dead,\u0027 for only Amnon is dead.\u0027","15":"Then Amnon hated her with a very great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, \u0027Get up, go away!\u0027","34":"Now Absalom had fled. And the young man who was the watchman raised his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain.","21":"Now when King David heard of all these matters, he was very angry.","24":"Absalom came to the king and said, \u0027Behold now, your servant has sheepshearers; please let the king and his servants go with your servant.\u0027","16":"But she said to him, \u0027No, because this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you have done to me!\u0027 Yet he would not listen to her.","35":"Jonadab said to the king, \u0027Behold, the king\u0027s sons have come; according to your servant\u0027s word, so it happened.\u0027","32":"Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David\u0027s brother, responded, \u0027Do not let my lord suppose they have put to death all the young men, the king\u0027s sons, for Amnon alone is dead; because by the intent of Absalom this has been determined since the day that he violated his sister Tamar.","7":"Then David sent to the house for Tamar, saying, \u0027Go now to your brother Amnon\u0027s house, and prepare food for him.\u0027","2":"Amnon was so frustrated because of his sister Tamar that he made himself ill, for she was a virgin, and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.","38":"So Absalom had fled and gone to Geshur, and was there three years.","6":"So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill; when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, \u0027Please let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.\u0027","31":"Then the king arose, tore his clothes and lay on the ground; and all his servants were standing by with clothes torn."}}}
