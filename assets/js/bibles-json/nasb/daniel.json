But the God in whose hand are your life-breath and your ways, you have not glorified.","19":"\u0027Because of the grandeur which He bestowed on him, all the peoples, nations and [men of every] language feared and trembled before him; whomever he wished he killed and whomever he wished he spared alive; and whomever he wished he elevated and whomever he wished he humbled.","1":"Belshazzar the king held a great feast for a thousand of his nobles, and he was drinking wine in the presence of the thousand.","5":"Suddenly the fingers of a man\u0027s hand emerged and began writing opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king\u0027s palace, and the king saw the back of the hand that did the writing.","4":"They drank the wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone.","8":"Then all the king\u0027s wise men came in, but they could not read the inscription or make known its interpretation to the king.","26":"\u0027This is the interpretation of the message: \u0027MENE \u0027-- God has numbered your kingdom and put an end to it.","14":"\u0027Now I have heard about you that a spirit of the gods is in you, and that illumination, insight and extraordinary wisdom have been found in you.","22":"\u0027Yet you, his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this,","28":"\u0027\u0027PERES \u0027-- your kingdom has been divided and given over to the Medes and Persians.\u0027","25":"\u0027Now this is the inscription that was written out: \u0027MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.\u0027","9":"Then King Belshazzar was greatly alarmed, his face grew [even] paler, and his nobles were perplexed.","15":"\u0027Just now the wise men [and] the conjurers were brought in before me that they might read this inscription and make its interpretation known to me, but they could not declare the interpretation of the message.","21":"\u0027He was also driven away from mankind, and his heart was made like [that of] beasts, and his dwelling place [was] with the wild donkeys. He was given grass to eat like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until he recognized that the Most High God is ruler over the realm of mankind and [that] He sets over it whomever He wishes.","24":"\u0027Then the hand was sent from Him and this inscription was written out.","16":"\u0027But I personally have heard about you, that you are able to give interpretations and solve difficult problems. Now if you are able to read the inscription and make its interpretation known to me, you will be clothed with purple and [wear] a necklace of gold around your neck, and you will have authority as the third [ruler] in the kingdom.\u0027","7":"The king called aloud to bring in the conjurers, the Chaldeans and the diviners. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, \u0027Any man who can read this inscription and explain its interpretation to me shall be clothed with purple and [have] a necklace of gold around his neck, and have authority as third [ruler] in the kingdom.\u0027","2":"When Belshazzar tasted the wine, he gave orders to bring the gold and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which [was] in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them.","6":"Then the king\u0027s face grew pale and his thoughts alarmed him, and his hip joints went slack and his knees began knocking together.","31":"So Darius the Mede received the kingdom at about the age of sixty-two."},"8":{"11":"It even magnified [itself] to be equal with the Commander of the host; and it removed the regular sacrifice from Him, and the place of His sanctuary was thrown down.","3":"Then I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, a ram which had two horns was standing in front of the canal. Now the two horns [were] long, but one [was] longer than the other, with the longer one coming up last.","20":"\u0027The ram which you saw with the two horns represents the kings of Media and Persia.","12":"And on account of transgression the host will be given over [to the horn] along with the regular sacrifice; and it will fling truth to the ground and perform [its will] and prosper.","10":"It grew up to the host of heaven and caused some of the host and some of the stars to fall to the earth, and it trampled them down.","17":"So he came near to where I was standing, and when he came I was frightened and fell on my face; but he said to me, \u0027Son of man, understand that the vision pertains to the time of the end.\u0027","13":"Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to that particular one who was speaking, \u0027How long will the vision [about] the regular sacrifice apply, while the transgression causes horror, so as to allow both the holy place and the host to be trampled?\u0027","27":"Then I, Daniel, was exhausted and sick for days.
