Those were the mighty men who [were] of old, men of renown.","19":"\u0027And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every [kind] into the ark, to keep [them] alive with you; they shall be male and female.","13":"Then God said to Noah, \u0027The end of all flesh has come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence because of them; and behold, I am about to destroy them with the earth."},"31":{"11":"\u0027Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, \u0027Jacob,\u0027 and I said, \u0027Here I am.\u0027","41":"\u0027These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you changed my wages ten times.","45":"Then Jacob took a stone and set it up [as] a pillar.","42":"\u0027If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had not been for me, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, so He rendered judgment last night.\u0027","3":"Then the LORD said to Jacob, \u0027Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you.\u0027","20":"And Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was fleeing.","12":"\u0027He said, \u0027Lift up now your eyes and see [that] all the male goats which are mating are striped, speckled, and mottled; for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.","10":"\u0027And it came about at the time when the flock were mating that I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which were mating [were] striped, speckled, and mottled.","17":"Then Jacob arose and put his children and his wives upon camels;","51":"Laban said to Jacob, \u0027Behold this heap and behold the pillar which I have set between you and me.","44":"\u0027So now come, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it be a witness between you and me.\u0027","40":"\u0027[Thus] I was: by day the heat consumed me and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.","13":"\u0027I am the God [of] Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you made a vow to Me; now arise, leave this land, and return to the land of your birth.\u0027\u0027","27":"\u0027Why did you flee secretly and deceive me, and did not tell me so that I might have sent you away with joy and with songs, with timbrel and with lyre;","30":"\u0027Now you have indeed gone away because you longed greatly for your father\u0027s house; [but] why did you steal my gods?\u0027","53":"\u0027The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.\u0027 So Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.","18":"and he drove away all his livestock and all his property which he had gathered, his acquired livestock which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.","36":"Then Jacob became angry and contended with Laban; and Jacob said to Laban, \u0027What is my transgression? What is my sin that you have hotly pursued me?","29":"\u0027It is in my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, \u0027Be careful not to speak either good or bad to Jacob.\u0027","23":"then he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him [a distance of] seven days\u0027 journey, and he overtook him in the hill country of Gilead.","19":"When Laban had gone to shear his flock, then Rachel stole the household idols that were her father\u0027s.","1":"Now Jacob heard the words of Laban\u0027s sons, saying, \u0027Jacob has taken away all that was our father\u0027s, and from what belonged to our father he has made all this wealth.\u0027","47":"Now Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.","5":"and said to them, \u0027I see your father\u0027s attitude, that it is not [friendly] toward me as formerly, but the God of my father has been with me.","54":"Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his kinsmen to the meal; and they ate the meal and spent the night on the mountain.","52":"\u0027This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass by this heap to you for harm, and you will not pass by this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.","49":"and Mizpah, for he said, \u0027May the LORD watch between you and me when we are absent one from the other.","4":"So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to his flock in the field,","8":"\u0027If he spoke thus, \u0027The speckled shall be your wages,\u0027 then all the flock brought forth speckled; and if he spoke thus, \u0027The striped shall be your wages,\u0027 then all the flock brought forth striped.","26":"Then Laban said to Jacob, \u0027What have you done by deceiving me and carrying away my daughters like captives of the sword?","39":"\u0027That which was torn [of beasts] I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it myself. You required it of my hand [whether] stolen by day or stolen by night.","14":"Rachel and Leah said to him, \u0027Do we still have any portion or inheritance in our father\u0027s house?","37":"\u0027Though you have felt through all my goods, what have you found of all your household goods? Set [it] here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two.","22":"When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled,","28":"and did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now you have done foolishly.","25":"Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen camped in the hill country of Gilead.","9":"\u0027Thus God has taken away your father\u0027s livestock and given [them] to me.","33":"So Laban went into Jacob\u0027s tent and into Leah\u0027s tent and into the tent of the two maids, but he did not find [them]. Then he went out of Leah\u0027s tent and entered Rachel\u0027s tent.","15":"\u0027Are we not reckoned by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also entirely consumed our purchase price.","34":"Now Rachel had taken the household idols and put them in the camel\u0027s saddle, and she sat on them. And Laban felt through all the tent but did not find [them].","21":"So he fled with all that he had; and he arose and crossed the [Euphrates] River, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.","24":"God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night and said to him, \u0027Be careful that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad.\u0027","46":"Jacob said to his kinsmen, \u0027Gather stones.\u0027 So they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap.","16":"\u0027Surely all the wealth which God has taken away from our father belongs to us and our children; now then, do whatever God has said to you.\u0027","35":"She said to her father, \u0027Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the manner of women is upon me.\u0027 So he searched but did not find the household idols.","32":"\u0027The one with whom you find your gods shall not live; in the presence of our kinsmen point out what is yours among my belongings and take [it] for yourself.\u0027 For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.","7":"\u0027Yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times; however, God did not allow him to hurt me.","43":"Then Laban replied to Jacob, \u0027The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne?","48":"Laban said, \u0027This heap is a witness between you and me this day.\u0027 Therefore it was named Galeed,","2":"Jacob saw the attitude of Laban, and behold, it was not [friendly] toward him as formerly.","38":"\u0027These twenty years I [have been] with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten the rams of your flocks.","55":"Early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned to his place.","50":"\u0027If you mistreat my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, [although] no man is with us, see, God is witness between you and me.\u0027","6":"\u0027You know that I have served your father with all my strength.","31":"Then Jacob replied to Laban, \u0027Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force."}}}
