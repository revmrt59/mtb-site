always lives to make intercession for them.","9":"And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes,","15":"And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek,","21":"(for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him, \u0027THE LORD HAS SWORN AND WILL NOT CHANGE HIS MIND, \u0027YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER \u0027\u0027);","24":"but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently.","16":"who has become [such] not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.","7":"But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.","2":"to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all [the spoils], was first of all, by the translation [of his name], king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace.","6":"But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises."},"6":{"16":"For men swear by one greater [than themselves], and with them an oath [given] as confirmation is an end of every dispute.","3":"And this we will do, if God permits.","5":"and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,","18":"so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us.","12":"so that you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.","10":"For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name, in having ministered and in still ministering to the saints.","2":"of instruction about washings and laying on of hands, and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.","8":"but if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned.","17":"In the same way God, desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose, interposed with an oath,","11":"And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end,","1":"Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,","9":"But, beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and things that accompany salvation, though we are speaking in this way.","14":"saying, \u0027I WILL SURELY BLESS YOU AND I WILL SURELY MULTIPLY YOU.\u0027","7":"For ground that drinks the rain which often falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God;","15":"And so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise.","20":"where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.","6":"and [then] have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame.","4":"For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,","19":"This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a [hope] both sure and steadfast and one which enters within the veil,","13":"For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself,"},"4":{"16":"Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.","3":"For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said, \u0027AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH, THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST,\u0027 although His works were finished from the foundation of the world.","5":"and again in this [passage], \u0027THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST.\u0027","12":"For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.","10":"For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His.","2":"For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard.","8":"For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken of another day after that.","11":"Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest, so that no one will fall, through [following] the same example of disobedience.","1":"Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it.","9":"So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.","14":"Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.","7":"He again fixes a certain day, \u0027Today,\u0027 saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before, \u0027TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE, DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS.\u0027","15":"For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as [we are, yet] without sin.","6":"Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience,","4":"For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh [day]: \u0027AND GOD RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY FROM ALL HIS WORKS\u0027;","13":"And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do."},"13":{"16":"And do not neglect doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.","3":"Remember the prisoners, as though in prison with them, [and] those who are ill-treated, since you yourselves also are in the body.","5":"[Make sure that] your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, \u0027I WILL NEVER DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,\u0027","21":"equip you in every good thing to do His will, working in us that which is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom [be] the glory forever and ever. Amen.","18":"Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a good conscience, desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things.","12":"Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate.","10":"We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.","2":"Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it.","22":"But I urge you, brethren, bear with this word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.","8":"Jesus Christ [is] the same yesterday and today and forever.","17":"Obey your leaders and submit [to them], for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.","11":"For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest [as an offering] for sin, are burned outside the camp.","1":"Let love of the brethren continue.","9":"Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings; for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited.","24":"Greet all of your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.","14":"For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking [the city] which is to come.","7":"Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you; and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith.","15":"Through Him then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name.","20":"Now the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the eternal covenant, [even] Jesus our Lord,","25":"Grace be with you all.","23":"Take notice that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom, if he comes soon, I will see you.","6":"so that we confidently say, \u0027THE LORD IS MY HELPER, I WILL NOT BE AFRAID. WHAT WILL MAN DO TO ME?\u0027","4":"Marriage [is to be held] in honor among all, and the [marriage] bed [is to be] undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.","19":"And I urge [you] all the more to do this, so that I may be restored to you the sooner.","13":"So, let us go out to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach."}}}
