I have put My Spirit upon Him; He will bring forth justice to the nations.","9":"\u0027Behold, the former things have come to pass, Now I declare new things; Before they spring forth I proclaim [them] to you.\u0027","24":"Who gave Jacob up for spoil, and Israel to plunderers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned, And in whose ways they were not willing to walk, And whose law they did not obey?","14":"\u0027I have kept silent for a long time, I have kept still and restrained Myself. [Now] like a woman in labor I will groan, I will both gasp and pant.","7":"To open blind eyes, To bring out prisoners from the dungeon And those who dwell in darkness from the prison.","15":"\u0027I will lay waste the mountains and hills And wither all their vegetation; I will make the rivers into coastlands And dry up the ponds.","20":"You have seen many things, but you do not observe [them]; [Your] ears are open, but none hears.","25":"So He poured out on him the heat of His anger And the fierceness of battle; And it set him aflame all around, Yet he did not recognize [it]; And it burned him, but he paid no attention.","23":"Who among you will give ear to this? Who will give heed and listen hereafter?","6":"\u0027I am the LORD, I have called you in righteousness, I will also hold you by the hand and watch over you, And I will appoint you as a covenant to the people, As a light to the nations,","4":"\u0027He will not be disheartened or crushed Until He has established justice in the earth; And the coastlands will wait expectantly for His law.\u0027","19":"Who is blind but My servant, Or so deaf as My messenger whom I send? Who is so blind as he that is at peace [with Me], Or so blind as the servant of the LORD?","13":"The LORD will go forth like a warrior, He will arouse [His] zeal like a man of war. He will utter a shout, yes, He will raise a war cry. He will prevail against His enemies."}}}
