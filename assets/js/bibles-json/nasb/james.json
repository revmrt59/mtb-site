Can that faith save him?","7":"Do they not blaspheme the fair name by which you have been called?","15":"If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food,","20":"But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless?","25":"In the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?","23":"and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, \u0027AND ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS,\u0027 and he was called the friend of God.","6":"But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you and personally drag you into court?","4":"have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil motives?","19":"You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder.","13":"For judgment [will be] merciless to one who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.","26":"For just as the body without [the] spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead."},"4":{"16":"But as it is, you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil.","3":"You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend [it] on your pleasures.","5":"Or do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose: \u0027He jealously desires the Spirit which He has made to dwell in us\u0027?","12":"There is [only] one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and to destroy; but who are you who judge your neighbor?","10":"Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.","2":"You lust and do not have; [so] you commit murder.

Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.","17":"Therefore, to one who knows [the] right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin.","11":"Do not speak against one another, brethren. He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law; but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge [of it].","1":"What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your members?","9":"Be miserable and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy to gloom.","14":"Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are [just] a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.","7":"Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.","15":"Instead, [you ought] to say, \u0027If the Lord wills, we will live and also do this or that.\u0027","6":"But He gives a greater grace. Therefore [it] says, \u0027GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE.\u0027","4":"You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.","13":"Come now, you who say, \u0027Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit.\u0027"},"5":{"16":"Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed.

You have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the outcome of the Lord\u0027s dealings, that the Lord is full of compassion and [is] merciful.","1":"Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries which are coming upon you.","9":"Do not complain, brethren, against one another, so that you yourselves may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing right at the door.","14":"Is anyone among you sick? [Then] he must call for the elders of the church and they are to pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord;","7":"Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil, being patient about it, until it gets the early and late rains.","15":"and the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him.","20":"let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.","6":"You have condemned and put to death the righteous [man]; he does not resist you.","4":"Behold, the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields, [and] which has been withheld by you, cries out [against you]; and the outcry of those who did the harvesting has reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.","19":"My brethren, if any among you strays from the truth and one turns him back,","13":"Is anyone among you suffering? [Then] he must pray. Is anyone cheerful?

But everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak [and] slow to anger;","1":"James, a bond-servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes who are dispersed abroad: Greetings.","5":"But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.","4":"And let endurance have [its] perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.","8":"[being] a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.","26":"If anyone thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his [own] heart, this man\u0027s religion is worthless.","14":"But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.","22":"But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves.","25":"But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the [law] of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does.","9":"But the brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position;","15":"Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death.","21":"Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and [all] that remains of wickedness, in humility receive the word implanted, which is able to save your souls.","24":"for [once] he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was.","16":"Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.","7":"For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord,","2":"Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials,","6":"But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind."},"3":{"16":"For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing.","3":"Now if we put the bits into the horses\u0027 mouths so that they will obey us, we direct their entire body as well.","5":"So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and [yet] it boasts of great things. See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire!","18":"And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.","12":"Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a vine produce figs? Nor [can] salt water produce fresh.","10":"from the same mouth come [both] blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be this way.","2":"For we all stumble in many [ways].
