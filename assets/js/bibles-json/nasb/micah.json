From her who lies in your bosom Guard your lips.","18":"Who is a God like You, who pardons iniquity And passes over the rebellious act of the remnant of His possession?

Though I fall I will rise; Though I dwell in darkness, the LORD is a light for me.","17":"They will lick the dust like a serpent, Like reptiles of the earth. They will come trembling out of their fortresses; To the LORD our God they will come in dread And they will be afraid before You.","11":"[It will be] a day for building your walls. On that day will your boundary be extended.","1":"Woe is me! For I am Like the fruit pickers, like the grape gatherers. There is not a cluster of grapes to eat, [Or] a first-ripe fig [which] I crave.","9":"I will bear the indignation of the LORD Because I have sinned against Him, Until He pleads my case and executes justice for me. He will bring me out to the light, [And] I will see His righteousness.","14":"Shepherd Your people with Your scepter, The flock of Your possession Which dwells by itself in the woodland, In the midst of a fruitful field.

My God will hear me.","15":"\u0027As in the days when you came out from the land of Egypt, I will show you miracles.\u0027","20":"You will give truth to Jacob [And] unchanging love to Abraham, Which You swore to our forefathers From the days of old.","6":"For son treats father contemptuously, Daughter rises up against her mother, Daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; A man\u0027s enemies are the men of his own household.","4":"The best of them is like a briar, The most upright like a thorn hedge. The day when you post your watchmen, Your punishment will come. Then their confusion will occur.","19":"He will again have compassion on us; He will tread our iniquities under foot. Yes, You will cast all their sins Into the depths of the sea.","13":"And the earth will become desolate because of her inhabitants, On account of the fruit of their deeds."},"3":{"7":"The seers will be ashamed And the diviners will be embarrassed. Indeed, they will all cover [their] mouths Because there is no answer from God.","9":"Now hear this, heads of the house of Jacob And rulers of the house of Israel, Who abhor justice And twist everything that is straight,","10":"Who build Zion with bloodshed And Jerusalem with violent injustice.","3":"Who eat the flesh of my people, Strip off their skin from them, Break their bones And chop [them] up as for the pot And as meat in a kettle.\u0027","11":"Her leaders pronounce judgment for a bribe, Her priests instruct for a price And her prophets divine for money. Yet they lean on the LORD saying, \u0027Is not the LORD in our midst? Calamity will not come upon us.\u0027","2":"\u0027You who hate good and love evil, Who tear off their skin from them And their flesh from their bones,","1":"And I said, \u0027Hear now, heads of Jacob And rulers of the house of Israel. Is it not for you to know justice?","12":"Therefore, on account of you Zion will be plowed as a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins, And the mountain of the temple [will become] high places of a forest.","4":"Then they will cry out to the LORD, But He will not answer them. Instead, He will hide His face from them at that time Because they have practiced evil deeds.","6":"Therefore [it will be] night for you-- without vision, And darkness for you-- without divination. The sun will go down on the prophets, And the day will become dark over them.","5":"Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who lead my people astray; When they have [something] to bite with their teeth, They cry, \u0027Peace,\u0027 But against him who puts nothing in their mouths They declare holy war.","8":"On the other hand I am filled with power-- With the Spirit of the LORD-- And with justice and courage To make known to Jacob his rebellious act, Even to Israel his sin."},"2":{"3":"Therefore thus says the LORD, \u0027Behold, I am planning against this family a calamity From which you cannot remove your necks; And you will not walk haughtily, For it will be an evil time.","5":"\u0027Therefore you will have no one stretching a measuring line For you by lot in the assembly of the LORD.","12":"\u0027I will surely assemble all of you, Jacob, I will surely gather the remnant of Israel.

They rob a man and his house, A man and his inheritance.","8":"\u0027Recently My people have arisen as an enemy-- You strip the robe off the garment From unsuspecting passers-by, [From] those returned from war.","11":"\u0027If a man walking after wind and falsehood Had told lies [and said], \u0027I will speak out to you concerning wine and liquor,\u0027 He would be spokesman to this people.","1":"Woe to those who scheme iniquity, Who work out evil on their beds! When morning comes, they do it, For it is in the power of their hands.","9":"\u0027The women of My people you evict, Each [one] from her pleasant house. From her children you take My splendor forever.","7":"\u0027Is it being said, O house of Jacob: \u0027Is the Spirit of the LORD impatient? Are these His doings?\u0027 Do not My words do good To the one walking uprightly?","6":"\u0027Do not speak out,\u0027 [so] they speak out.

So their king goes on before them, And the LORD at their head.\u0027"},"1":{"16":"Make yourself bald and cut off your hair, Because of the children of your delight; Extend your baldness like the eagle, For they will go from you into exile.","3":"For behold, the LORD is coming forth from His place. He will come down and tread on the high places of the earth.","5":"All this is for the rebellion of Jacob And for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the rebellion of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? What is the high place of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem?","12":"For the inhabitant of Maroth Becomes weak waiting for good, Because a calamity has come down from the LORD To the gate of Jerusalem.","10":"Tell it not in Gath, Weep not at all. At Beth-le-aphrah roll yourself in the dust.","2":"Hear, O peoples, all of you; Listen, O earth and all it contains, And let the Lord GOD be a witness against you, The Lord from His holy temple.","8":"Because of this I must lament and wail, I must go barefoot and naked; I must make a lament like the jackals And a mourning like the ostriches.","11":"Go on your way, inhabitant of Shaphir, in shameful nakedness.
