She also took [it] out and gave Naomi what she had left after she was satisfied.","12":"\u0027May the LORD reward your work, and your wages be full from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to seek refuge.\u0027","10":"Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground and said to him, \u0027Why have I found favor in your sight that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?\u0027","2":"And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, \u0027Please let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after one in whose sight I may find favor.\u0027 And she said to her, \u0027Go, my daughter.\u0027","22":"Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, \u0027It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maids, so that [others] do not fall upon you in another field.\u0027","8":"Then Boaz said to Ruth, \u0027Listen carefully, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field; furthermore, do not go on from this one, but stay here with my maids.","17":"So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.","11":"Boaz replied to her, \u0027All that you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband has been fully reported to me, and how you left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and came to a people that you did not previously know.","1":"Now Naomi had a kinsman of her husband, a man of great wealth, of the family of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz.","9":"\u0027Let your eyes be on the field which they reap, and go after them. Indeed, I have commanded the servants not to touch you. When you are thirsty, go to the water jars and drink from what the servants draw.\u0027","14":"At mealtime Boaz said to her, \u0027Come here, that you may eat of the bread and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.\u0027 So she sat beside the reapers; and he served her roasted grain, and she ate and was satisfied and had some left.","7":"\u0027And she said, \u0027Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.\u0027 Thus she came and has remained from the morning until now; she has been sitting in the house for a little while.\u0027","15":"When she rose to glean, Boaz commanded his servants, saying, \u0027Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not insult her.","20":"Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, \u0027May he be blessed of the LORD who has not withdrawn his kindness to the living and to the dead.\u0027 Again Naomi said to her, \u0027The man is our relative, he is one of our closest relatives.\u0027","23":"So she stayed close by the maids of Boaz in order to glean until the end of the barley harvest and the wheat harvest. And she lived with her mother-in-law.","6":"The servant in charge of the reapers replied, \u0027She is the young Moabite woman who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab.","4":"Now behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, \u0027May the LORD be with you.\u0027 And they said to him, \u0027May the LORD bless you.\u0027","19":"Her mother-in-law then said to her, \u0027Where did you glean today and where did you work? May he who took notice of you be blessed.\u0027 So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said, \u0027The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz.\u0027","13":"Then she said, \u0027I have found favor in your sight, my lord, for you have comforted me and indeed have spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not like one of your maidservants.\u0027"},"4":{"16":"Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her lap, and became his nurse.","3":"Then he said to the closest relative, \u0027Naomi, who has come back from the land of Moab, has to sell the piece of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech.","5":"Then Boaz said, \u0027On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the deceased, in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance.\u0027","21":"and to Salmon was born Boaz, and to Boaz, Obed,","18":"Now these are the generations of Perez: to Perez was born Hezron,","12":"\u0027Moreover, may your house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah, through the offspring which the LORD will give you by this young woman.\u0027","10":"\u0027Moreover, I have acquired Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, to be my wife in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance, so that the name of the deceased will not be cut off from his brothers or from the court of his [birth] place; you are witnesses today.\u0027","2":"He took ten men of the elders of the city and said, \u0027Sit down here.\u0027 So they sat down.","22":"and to Obed was born Jesse, and to Jesse, David.","8":"So the closest relative said to Boaz, \u0027Buy [it] for yourself.\u0027 And he removed his sandal.","17":"The neighbor women gave him a name, saying, \u0027A son has been born to Naomi!\u0027 So they named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.","11":"All the people who were in the court, and the elders, said, \u0027[We are] witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, both of whom built the house of Israel; and may you achieve wealth in Ephrathah and become famous in Bethlehem.","1":"Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there, and behold, the close relative of whom Boaz spoke was passing by, so he said, \u0027Turn aside, friend, sit down here.\u0027 And he turned aside and sat down.","9":"Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, \u0027You are witnesses today that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon.","14":"Then the women said to Naomi, \u0027Blessed is the LORD who has not left you without a redeemer today, and may his name become famous in Israel.","7":"Now this was [the custom] in former times in Israel concerning the redemption and the exchange [of land] to confirm any matter: a man removed his sandal and gave it to another; and this was the [manner of] attestation in Israel.","15":"\u0027May he also be to you a restorer of life and a sustainer of your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.\u0027","20":"and to Amminadab was born Nahshon, and to Nahshon, Salmon,","6":"The closest relative said, \u0027I cannot redeem [it] for myself, because I would jeopardize my own inheritance. Redeem [it] for yourself; you [may have] my right of redemption, for I cannot redeem [it].\u0027","4":"\u0027So I thought to inform you, saying, \u0027Buy [it] before those who are sitting [here], and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem [it], redeem [it]; but if not, tell me that I may know; for there is no one but you to redeem [it], and I am after you.\u0027\u0027 And he said, \u0027I will redeem [it].\u0027","19":"and to Hezron was born Ram, and to Ram, Amminadab,","13":"So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife, and he went in to her. And the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son."},"1":{"16":"But Ruth said, \u0027Do not urge me to leave you [or] turn back from following you; for where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people [shall be] my people, and your God, my God.","3":"Then Elimelech, Naomi\u0027s husband, died; and she was left with her two sons.","5":"Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and the woman was bereft of her two children and her husband.","21":"\u0027I went out full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the LORD has witnessed against me and the Almighty has afflicted me?\u0027","18":"When she saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more to her.","12":"\u0027Return, my daughters! Go, for I am too old to have a husband. If I said I have hope, if I should even have a husband tonight and also bear sons,","10":"And they said to her, \u0027[No], but we will surely return with you to your people.\u0027","2":"The name of the man [was] Elimelech, and the name of his wife, Naomi; and the names of his two sons [were] Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem in Judah. Now they entered the land of Moab and remained there.","22":"So Naomi returned, and with her Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, who returned from the land of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest.","8":"And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, \u0027Go, return each of you to her mother\u0027s house. May the LORD deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me.","17":"\u0027Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. Thus may the LORD do to me, and worse, if [anything but] death parts you and me.\u0027","11":"But Naomi said, \u0027Return, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?","1":"Now it came about in the days when the judges governed, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the land of Moab with his wife and his two sons.","9":"\u0027May the LORD grant that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband.\u0027 Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept.","14":"And they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.","7":"So she departed from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.","15":"Then she said, \u0027Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and her gods; return after your sister-in-law.\u0027","20":"She said to them, \u0027Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.","6":"Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the land of Moab, for she had heard in the land of Moab that the LORD had visited His people in giving them food.","4":"They took for themselves Moabite women [as] wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. And they lived there about ten years.","19":"So they both went until they came to Bethlehem. And when they had come to Bethlehem, all the city was stirred because of them, and the women said, \u0027Is this Naomi?\u0027","13":"would you therefore wait until they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying? No, my daughters; for it is harder for me than for you, for the hand of the LORD has gone forth against me.\u0027"},"3":{"16":"When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, \u0027How did it go, my daughter?\u0027 And she told her all that the man had done for her.","3":"\u0027Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself and put on your [best] clothes, and go down to the threshing floor; [but] do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.","5":"She said to her, \u0027All that you say I will do.\u0027","18":"Then she said, \u0027Wait, my daughter, until you know how the matter turns out; for the man will not rest until he has settled it today.\u0027","12":"\u0027Now it is true I am a close relative; however, there is a relative closer than I.","10":"Then he said, \u0027May you be blessed of the LORD, my daughter. You have shown your last kindness to be better than the first by not going after young men, whether poor or rich.","2":"\u0027Now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maids you were? Behold, he winnows barley at the threshing floor tonight.","8":"It happened in the middle of the night that the man was startled and bent forward; and behold, a woman was lying at his feet.","17":"She said, \u0027These six [measures] of barley he gave to me, for he said, \u0027Do not go to your mother-in-law empty-handed.\u0027\u0027","11":"\u0027Now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you whatever you ask, for all my people in the city know that you are a woman of excellence.","1":"Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, \u0027My daughter, shall I not seek security for you, that it may be well with you?","9":"He said, \u0027Who are you?\u0027 And she answered, \u0027I am Ruth your maid. So spread your covering over your maid, for you are a close relative.\u0027","14":"So she lay at his feet until morning and rose before one could recognize another; and he said, \u0027Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.\u0027","7":"When Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came secretly, and uncovered his feet and lay down.","15":"Again he said, \u0027Give me the cloak that is on you and hold it.\u0027 So she held it, and he measured six [measures] of barley and laid [it] on her. Then she went into the city.","6":"So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had commanded her.","4":"\u0027It shall be when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies, and you shall go and uncover his feet and lie down; then he will tell you what you shall do.\u0027","13":"\u0027Remain this night, and when morning comes, if he will redeem you, good; let him redeem you. But if he does not wish to redeem you, then I will redeem you, as the LORD lives. Lie down until morning.\u0027"}}}
