This he did to fulfill the requirements of the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had discovered in the temple of the Lord.","16":"Then Josiah looked around, and when he saw the tombs that were there on the hillside, he had the bones removed from them and burned on the altar to defile it, in accordance with the word of the Lord proclaimed by the man of God who foretold these things.","35":"Jehoiakim paid Pharaoh Neco the silver and gold he demanded. In order to do so, he taxed the land and exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land according to their assessments.","32":"He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, just as his fathers had done.","7":"He also tore down the quarters of the male shrine prostitutes, which were in the temple of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah.","2":"He went up to the temple of the Lord with the men of Judah, the people of Jerusalem, the priests and the prophets—all the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the Lord.","6":"He took the Asherah pole from the temple of the Lord to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem and burned it there.

Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he was on his guard in such places.","17":"And Elisha prayed, “O Lord, open his eyes so he may see.” Then the Lord opened the servant’s eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.","13":"“Go, find out where he is,” the king ordered, “so I can send men and capture him.” The report came back: “He is in Dothan.”","27":"The king replied, “If the Lord does not help you, where can I get help for you? From the threshing floor? From the winepress?”","30":"When the king heard the woman’s words, he tore his robes.

The next day I said to her, ‘Give up your son so we may eat him,’ but she had hidden him.”","23":"So he prepared a great feast for them, and after they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them away, and they returned to their master.

They went by night and surrounded the city.","22":"“Do not kill them,” he answered. “Would you kill men you have captured with your own sword or bow? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink and then go back to their master.”","28":"Then he asked her, “What’s the matter?”She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give up your son so we may eat him today, and tomorrow we’ll eat my son.’","25":"There was a great famine in the city; the siege lasted so long that a donkey’s head sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a quarter of a cab of seed pods for five shekels.","9":"The man of God sent word to the king of Israel: “Beware of passing that place, because the Arameans are going down there.”","33":"While he was still talking to them, the messenger came down to him. And the king said, “This disaster is from the Lord. Why should I wait for the Lord any longer?”","15":"When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. “Oh, my lord, what shall we do?” the servant asked.","21":"When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, “Shall I kill them, my father? Shall I kill them?”","24":"Famine in Besieged SamariaSome time later, Ben-Hadad king of Aram mobilized his entire army and marched up and laid siege to Samaria.","16":"“Don’t be afraid,” the prophet answered. “Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”","32":"Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a messenger ahead, but before he arrived, Elisha said to the elders, “Don’t you see how this murderer is sending someone to cut off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold it shut against him. Is not the sound of his master’s footsteps behind him?”","7":"“Lift it out,” he said. Then the man reached out his hand and took it.","2":"Let us go to the Jordan, where each of us can get a pole; and let us build a place there for us to live.”And he said, “Go.”","6":"The man of God asked, “Where did it fall?” When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it there, and made the iron float.","31":"He said, “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today!”"},"4":{"11":"One day when Elisha came, he went up to his room and lay down there.","41":"Elisha said, “Get some flour.” He put it into the pot and said, “Serve it to the people to eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot.","42":"Feeding of a HundredA man came from Baal Shalishah, bringing the man of God twenty loaves of barley bread baked from the first ripe grain, along with some heads of new grain. “Give it to the people to eat,” Elisha said.","3":"Elisha said, “Go around and ask all your neighbors for empty jars. Don’t ask for just a few.","20":"After the servant had lifted him up and carried him to his mother, the boy sat on her lap until noon, and then he died.","12":"He said to his servant Gehazi, “Call the Shunammite.” So he called her, and she stood before him.","10":"Let’s make a small room on the roof and put in it a bed and a table, a chair and a lamp for him. Then he can stay there whenever he comes to us.”","17":"But the woman became pregnant, and the next year about that same time she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told her.","44":"Then he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the Lord.","40":"The stew was poured out for the men, but as they began to eat it, they cried out, “O man of God, there is death in the pot!” And they could not eat it.","13":"Elisha said to him, “Tell her, ‘You have gone to all this trouble for us. Now what can be done for you? Can we speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army?’”She replied, “I have a home among my own people.”","27":"When she reached the man of God at the mountain, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi came over to push her away, but the man of God said, “Leave her alone! She is in bitter distress, but the Lord has hidden it from me and has not told me why.”","30":"But the child’s mother said, “As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you.” So he got up and followed her.","18":"The child grew, and one day he went out to his father, who was with the reapers.","36":"Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, “Call the Shunammite.” And he did. When she came, he said, “Take your son.”","29":"Elisha said to Gehazi, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand and run. If you meet anyone, do not greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not answer. Lay my staff on the boy’s face.”","23":"“Why go to him today?” he asked. “It’s not the New Moon or the Sabbath.”“It’s all right,” she said.","19":"“My head! My head!” he said to his father.His father told a servant, “Carry him to his mother.”","1":"The Widow’s OilThe wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to Elisha, “Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that he revered the Lord. But now his creditor is coming to take my two boys as his slaves.”","5":"She left him and afterward shut the door behind her and her sons. They brought the jars to her and she kept pouring.","4":"Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all the jars, and as each is filled, put it to one side.”","8":"The Shunammite’s Son Restored to LifeOne day Elisha went to Shunem. And a well-to-do woman was there, who urged him to stay for a meal. So whenever he came by, he stopped there to eat.","26":"Run to meet her and ask her, ‘Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?’”“Everything is all right,” she said.","39":"One of them went out into the fields to gather herbs and found a wild vine. He gathered some of its gourds and filled the fold of his cloak. When he returned, he cut them up into the pot of stew, though no one knew what they were.","14":"“What can be done for her?” Elisha asked.Gehazi said, “Well, she has no son and her husband is old.”","37":"She came in, fell at his feet and bowed to the ground. Then she took her son and went out.","22":"She called her husband and said, “Please send me one of the servants and a donkey so I can go to the man of God quickly and return.”","28":"“Did I ask you for a son, my lord?” she said. “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t raise my hopes’?”","25":"So she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel.When he saw her in the distance, the man of God said to his servant Gehazi, “Look! There’s the Shunammite!","9":"She said to her husband, “I know that this man who often comes our way is a holy man of God.","33":"He went in, shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the Lord.","15":"Then Elisha said, “Call her.” So he called her, and she stood in the doorway.","34":"Then he got on the bed and lay upon the boy, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands. As he stretched himself out upon him, the boy’s body grew warm.","21":"She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and went out.","24":"She saddled the donkey and said to her servant, “Lead on; don’t slow down for me unless I tell you.”","16":"“About this time next year,” Elisha said, “you will hold a son in your arms.”“No, my lord,” she objected. “Don’t mislead your servant, O man of God!”","35":"Elisha turned away and walked back and forth in the room and then got on the bed and stretched out upon him once more. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.","32":"When Elisha reached the house, there was the boy lying dead on his couch.","7":"She went and told the man of God, and he said, “Go, sell the oil and pay your debts. You and your sons can live on what is left.”","43":"“How can I set this before a hundred men?” his servant asked.But Elisha answered, “Give it to the people to eat. For this is what the Lord says: ‘They will eat and have some left over.’”","2":"Elisha replied to her, “How can I help you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?”“Your servant has nothing there at all,” she said, “except a little oil.”","38":"Death in the PotElisha returned to Gilgal and there was a famine in that region. While the company of the prophets was meeting with him, he said to his servant, “Put on the large pot and cook some stew for these men.”","6":"When all the jars were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another one.”But he replied, “There is not a jar left.” Then the oil stopped flowing.","31":"Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the boy’s face, but there was no sound or response.
