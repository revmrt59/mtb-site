And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siegeworks against it.","7":"Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for it is now that God favors what you do.","15":"Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man.","6":"Their love, their hateand their jealousy have long since vanished;never again will they have a partin anything that happens under the sun.","4":"Anyone who is among the living has hope—even a live dog is better off than a dead lion!","13":"Wisdom Better Than FollyI also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me:"},"10":{"16":"Woe to you, O land whose king was a servantand whose princes feast in the morning.","3":"Even as he walks along the road,the fool lacks senseand shows everyone how stupid he is.","5":"There is an evil I have seen under the sun,the sort of error that arises from a ruler:","18":"If a man is lazy, the rafters sag;if his hands are idle, the house leaks.","12":"Words from a wise man’s mouth are gracious,but a fool is consumed by his own lips.","10":"If the ax is dulland its edge unsharpened,more strength is neededbut skill will bring success.","2":"The heart of the wise inclines to the right,but the heart of the fool to the left.","8":"Whoever digs a pit may fall into it;whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.","17":"Blessed are you, O land whose king is of noble birthand whose princes eat at a proper time—for strength and not for drunkenness.","11":"If a snake bites before it is charmed,there is no profit for the charmer.","1":"As dead flies give perfume a bad smell,so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.","9":"Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them;whoever splits logs may be endangered by them.","14":"and the fool multiplies words.No one knows what is coming—who can tell him what will happen after him?","7":"I have seen slaves on horseback,while princes go on foot like slaves.","15":"A fool’s work wearies him;he does not know the way to town.","20":"Do not revile the king even in your thoughts,or curse the rich in your bedroom,because a bird of the air may carry your words,and a bird on the wing may report what you say.","6":"Fools are put in many high positions,while the rich occupy the low ones.","4":"If a ruler’s anger rises against you,do not leave your post;calmness can lay great errors to rest.","19":"A feast is made for laughter,and wine makes life merry,but money is the answer for everything.","13":"At the beginning his words are folly;at the end they are wicked madness—"},"3":{"16":"And I saw something else under the sun:In the place of judgment—wickedness was there,in the place of justice—wickedness was there.","3":"a time to kill and a time to heal,a time to tear down and a time to build,","5":"a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,a time to embrace and a time to refrain,","21":"Who knows if the spirit of man rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?”","18":"I also thought, “As for men, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals.","12":"I know that there is nothing better for men than to be happy and do good while they live.","10":"I have seen the burden God has laid on men.","2":"a time to be born and a time to die,a time to plant and a time to uproot,","22":"So I saw that there is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work, because that is his lot. For who can bring him to see what will happen after him?","8":"a time to love and a time to hate,a time for war and a time for peace.","17":"I thought in my heart,“God will bring to judgmentboth the righteous and the wicked,for there will be a time for every activity,a time for every deed.”","11":"He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end.","1":"A Time for EverythingThere is a time for everything,and a season for every activity under heaven:","9":"What does the worker gain from his toil?","14":"I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that men will revere him.","7":"a time to tear and a time to mend,a time to be silent and a time to speak,","15":"Whatever is has already been,and what will be has been before;and God will call the past to account.","20":"All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return.","6":"a time to search and a time to give up,a time to keep and a time to throw away,","4":"a time to weep and a time to laugh,a time to mourn and a time to dance,","19":"Man’s fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other.

Everything is meaningless.","13":"That everyone may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all his toil—this is the gift of God."},"11":{"7":"Remember Your Creator While YoungLight is sweet,and it pleases the eyes to see the sun.","9":"Be happy, young man, while you are young,and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth.Follow the ways of your heartand whatever your eyes see,but know that for all these thingsGod will bring you to judgment.","10":"So then, banish anxiety from your heartand cast off the troubles of your body,for youth and vigor are meaningless.","3":"If clouds are full of water,they pour rain upon the earth.Whether a tree falls to the south or to the north,in the place where it falls, there will it lie.","2":"Give portions to seven, yes to eight,for you do not know what disaster may come upon the land.","1":"Bread Upon the WatersCast your bread upon the waters,for after many days you will find it again.","4":"Whoever watches the wind will not plant;whoever looks at the clouds will not reap.","6":"Sow your seed in the morning,and at evening let not your hands be idle,for you do not know which will succeed,whether this or that,or whether both will do equally well.","5":"As you do not know the path of the wind,or how the body is formed in a mother’s womb,so you cannot understand the work of God,the Maker of all things.","8":"However many years a man may live,let him enjoy them all.But let him remember the days of darkness,for they will be many.Everything to come is meaningless."},"2":{"16":"For the wise man, like the fool, will not be long remembered;in days to come both will be forgotten.Like the fool, the wise man too must die!","3":"I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly—my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.","5":"I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.","21":"For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then he must leave all he owns to someone who has not worked for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.","18":"I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.","12":"Wisdom and Folly Are MeaninglessThen I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom,and also madness and folly.What more can the king’s successor dothan what has already been done?","10":"I denied myself nothing my eyes desired;I refused my heart no pleasure.My heart took delight in all my work,and this was the reward for all my labor.","2":"“Laughter,” I said, “is foolish. And what does pleasure accomplish?”","22":"What does a man get for all the toil and anxious striving with which he labors under the sun?","8":"I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired men and women singers, and a harem as well—the delights of the heart of man.","17":"Toil Is MeaninglessSo I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.","11":"Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had doneand what I had toiled to achieve,everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind;nothing was gained under the sun.","1":"Pleasures Are MeaninglessI thought in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good.” But that also proved to be meaningless.","9":"I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.","24":"A man can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in his work. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,","14":"The wise man has eyes in his head,while the fool walks in the darkness;but I came to realizethat the same fate overtakes them both.","7":"I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me.","15":"Then I thought in my heart,“The fate of the fool will overtake me also.What then do I gain by being wise?”I said in my heart,“This too is meaningless.”","20":"So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.","25":"for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?","23":"All his days his work is pain and grief; even at night his mind does not rest.

This is something new”?It was here already, long ago;it was here before our time.","2":"“Meaningless! Meaningless!”says the Teacher.“Utterly meaningless!Everything is meaningless.”","8":"All things are wearisome,more than one can say.The eye never has enough of seeing,nor the ear its fill of hearing.","17":"Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.","11":"There is no remembrance of men of old,and even those who are yet to comewill not be rememberedby those who follow.","1":"Everything Is MeaninglessThe words of the Teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem:","9":"What has been will be again,what has been done will be done again;there is nothing new under the sun.","14":"I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.","7":"All streams flow into the sea,yet the sea is never full.To the place the streams come from,there they return again.","15":"What is twisted cannot be straightened;what is lacking cannot be counted.","6":"The wind blows to the southand turns to the north;round and round it goes,ever returning on its course.","4":"Generations come and generations go,but the earth remains forever.","13":"I devoted myself to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven.

Meaningless!” says the Teacher.“Everything is meaningless!”","11":"The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails—given by one Shepherd.","1":"Remember your Creatorin the days of your youth,before the days of trouble comeand the years approach when you will say,“I find no pleasure in them”—","9":"The Conclusion of the MatterNot only was the Teacher wise, but also he imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs.","14":"For God will bring every deed into judgment,including every hidden thing,whether it is good or evil.","7":"and the dust returns to the ground it came from,and the spirit returns to God who gave it.","6":"Remember him—before the silver cord is severed,or the golden bowl is broken;before the pitcher is shattered at the spring,or the wheel broken at the well,","4":"when the doors to the street are closedand the sound of grinding fades;when men rise up at the sound of birds,but all their songs grow faint;","13":"Now all has been heard;here is the conclusion of the matter:Fear God and keep his commandments,for this is the whole duty of man."},"4":{"16":"There was no end to all the people who were before them.

There is a time when a man lords it over others to his own hurt.","14":"There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth: righteous men who get what the wicked deserve, and wicked men who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless.","7":"Since no man knows the future,who can tell him what is to come?","15":"So I commend the enjoyment of life, because nothing is better for a man under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad. Then joy will accompany him in his work all the days of the life God has given him under the sun.","6":"For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter,though a man’s misery weighs heavily upon him.","4":"Since a king’s word is supreme, who can say to him, “What are you doing?”","13":"Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow."}}}
