It was Shimei son of Gera, from the same clan as Saul’s family.","21":"Ahithophel told him, “Go and sleep with your father’s concubines, for he has left them here to look after the palace. Then all Israel will know that you have insulted your father beyond hope of reconciliation, and they will throw their support to you.”","18":"“I’m here because I belong to the man who is chosen by the LORD and by all the men of Israel,” Hushai replied.","12":"And perhaps the LORD will see that I am being wronged and will bless me because of these curses today.”","10":"“No!” the king said. “Who asked your opinion, you sons of Zeruiah! If the LORD has told him to curse me, who are you to stop him?”","2":"“What are these for?” the king asked Ziba. Ziba replied, “The donkeys are for the king’s people to ride on, and the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat. The wine is for those who become exhausted in the wilderness.”","22":"So they set up a tent on the palace roof where everyone could see it, and Absalom went in and had sex with his father’s concubines.","8":"“The LORD is paying you back for all the bloodshed in Saul’s clan. You stole his throne, and now the LORD has given it to your son Absalom. At last you will taste some of your own medicine, for you are a murderer!”","17":"“Is this the way you treat your friend David?” Absalom asked him. “Why aren’t you with him?”","11":"Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “My own son is trying to kill me. Doesn’t this relative of Saul have even more reason to do so? Leave him alone and let him curse, for the LORD has told him to do it.","1":"When David had gone a little beyond the summit of the Mount of Olives, Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, was waiting there for him. He had two donkeys loaded with 200 loaves of bread, 100 clusters of raisins, 100 bunches of summer fruit, and a wineskin full of wine.","9":"“Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?” Abishai son of Zeruiah demanded. “Let me go over and cut off his head!”","14":"The king and all who were with him grew weary along the way, so they rested when they reached the Jordan River.","7":"“Get out of here, you murderer, you scoundrel!” he shouted at David.","15":"Meanwhile, Absalom and all the army of Israel arrived at Jerusalem, accompanied by Ahithophel.","20":"Then Absalom turned to Ahithophel and asked him, “What should I do next?”","23":"Absalom followed Ahithophel’s advice, just as David had done. For every word Ahithophel spoke seemed as wise as though it had come directly from the mouth of God.","6":"He threw stones at the king and the king’s officers and all the mighty warriors who surrounded him.","4":"“In that case,” the king told Ziba, “I give you everything Mephibosheth owns.” “I bow before you,” Ziba replied. “May I always be pleasing to you, my lord the king.”","19":"“And anyway, why shouldn’t I serve you? Just as I was your father’s adviser, now I will be your adviser!”","13":"So David and his men continued down the road, and Shimei kept pace with them on a nearby hillside, cursing and throwing stones and dirt at David."},"3":{"11":"Ishbosheth didn’t dare say another word because he was afraid of what Abner might do.","3":"The second was Daniel, whose mother was Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel.The third was Absalom, whose mother was Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur.","20":"When Abner and twenty of his men came to Hebron, David entertained them with a great feast.","12":"Then Abner sent messengers to David, saying, “Doesn’t the entire land belong to you? Make a solemn pact with me, and I will help turn over all of Israel to you.”","10":"I’m going to take Saul’s kingdom and give it to David. I will establish the throne of David over Israel as well as Judah, all the way from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south.”","17":"Meanwhile, Abner had consulted with the elders of Israel. “For some time now,” he told them, “you have wanted to make David your king.","13":"“All right,” David replied, “but I will not negotiate with you unless you bring back my wife Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come.”","27":"When Abner arrived back at Hebron, Joab took him aside at the gateway as if to speak with him privately. But then he stabbed Abner in the stomach and killed him in revenge for killing his brother Asahel.","30":"So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because Abner had killed their brother Asahel at the battle of Gibeon.","18":"Now is the time! For the LORD has said, ‘I have chosen David to save my people Israel from the hands of the Philistines and from all their other enemies.’”","36":"This pleased the people very much. In fact, everything the king did pleased them!","29":"Joab and his family are the guilty ones. May the family of Joab be cursed in every generation with a man who has open sores or leprosy or who walks on crutches or dies by the sword or begs for food!”","23":"When Joab arrived, he was told that Abner had just been there visiting the king and had been sent away in safety.","19":"Abner also spoke with the men of Benjamin. Then he went to Hebron to tell David that all the people of Israel and Benjamin had agreed to support him.","1":"That was the beginning of a long war between those who were loyal to Saul and those loyal to David. As time passed David became stronger and stronger, while Saul’s dynasty became weaker and weaker.","5":"The sixth was Ithream, whose mother was Eglah, David’s wife. These sons were all born to David in Hebron.","4":"The fourth was Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith.The fifth was Shephatiah, whose mother was Abital.","8":"Abner was furious. “Am I some Judean dog to be kicked around like this?” he shouted. “After all I have done for your father, Saul, and his family and friends by not handing you over to David, is this my reward — that you find fault with me about this woman?","26":"Joab then left David and sent messengers to catch up with Abner, asking him to return. They found him at the well of Sirah and brought him back, though David knew nothing about it.","39":"And even though I am the anointed king, these two sons of Zeruiah — Joab and Abishai — are too strong for me to control. So may the LORD repay these evil men for their evil deeds.”","14":"David then sent this message to Ishbosheth, Saul’s son: “Give me back my wife Michal, for I bought her with the lives of 100 Philistines.”","37":"So everyone in Judah and all Israel understood that David was not responsible for Abner’s murder.","22":"But just after David had sent Abner away in safety, Joab and some of David’s troops returned from a raid, bringing much plunder with them.","28":"When David heard about it, he declared, “I vow by the LORD that I and my kingdom are forever innocent of this crime against Abner son of Ner.","25":"You know perfectly well that he came to spy on you and find out everything you’re doing!”","9":"May God strike me and even kill me if I don’t do everything I can to help David get what the LORD has promised him!","33":"Then the king sang this funeral song for Abner: “Should Abner have died as fools die?","15":"So Ishbosheth took Michal away from her husband, Palti son of Laish.","34":"Your hands were not bound;your feet were not chained.No, you were murdered —the victim of a wicked plot.” All the people wept again for Abner.","21":"Then Abner said to David, “Let me go and call an assembly of all Israel to support my lord the king. They will make a covenant with you to make you their king, and you will rule over everything your heart desires.” So David sent Abner safely on his way.","24":"Joab rushed to the king and demanded, “What have you done? What do you mean by letting Abner get away?","16":"Palti followed along behind her as far as Bahurim, weeping as he went. Then Abner told him, “Go back home!” So Palti returned.","35":"David had refused to eat anything on the day of the funeral, and now everyone begged him to eat. But David had made a vow, saying, “May God strike me and even kill me if I eat anything before sundown.”","32":"They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king and all the people wept at his graveside.","7":"One day Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, accused Abner of sleeping with one of his father’s concubines, a woman named Rizpah, daughter of Aiah.","2":"These are the sons who were born to David in Hebron: The oldest was Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam from Jezreel.","38":"Then King David said to his officials, “Don’t you realize that a great commander has fallen today in Israel?","6":"As the war between the house of Saul and the house of David went on, Abner became a powerful leader among those loyal to Saul.","31":"Then David said to Joab and all those who were with him, “Tear your clothes and put on burlap. Mourn for Abner.” And King David himself walked behind the procession to the grave."},"5":{"16":"Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.","3":"So there at Hebron, King David made a covenant before the LORD with all the elders of Israel. And they anointed him king of Israel.","5":"He had reigned over Judah from Hebron for seven years and six months, and from Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah for thirty-three years.","21":"The Philistines had abandoned their idols there, so David and his men confiscated them.","18":"The Philistines arrived and spread out across the valley of Rephaim.","12":"And David realized that the LORD had confirmed him as king over Israel and had blessed his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.","10":"And David became more and more powerful, because the LORD God of Heaven’s Armies was with him.","2":"In the past, when Saul was our king, you were the one who really led the forces of Israel. And the LORD told you, ‘You will be the shepherd of my people Israel. You will be Israel’s leader.’”","22":"But after a while the Philistines returned and again spread out across the valley of Rephaim.","8":"On the day of the attack, David said to his troops, “I hate those ‘lame’ and ‘blind’ Jebusites. Whoever attacks them should strike by going into the city through the water tunnel. ” That is the origin of the saying, “The blind and the lame may not enter the house.”","17":"When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king of Israel, they mobilized all their forces to capture him. But David was told they were coming, so he went into the stronghold.","11":"Then King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar timber and carpenters and stonemasons, and they built David a palace.","1":"Then all the tribes of Israel went to David at Hebron and told him, “We are your own flesh and blood.","9":"So David made the fortress his home, and he called it the City of David. He extended the city, starting at the supporting terraces and working inward.","24":"When you hear a sound like marching feet in the tops of the poplar trees, be on the alert! That will be the signal that the LORD is moving ahead of you to strike down the Philistine army.”","14":"These are the names of David’s sons who were born in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,","7":"But David captured the fortress of Zion, which is now called the City of David.","15":"Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,","20":"So David went to Baal-perazim and defeated the Philistines there. “The LORD did it!” David exclaimed. “He burst through my enemies like a raging flood!” So he named that place Baal-perazim (which means “the Lord who bursts through”).","25":"So David did what the LORD commanded, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.","23":"And again David asked the LORD what to do. “Do not attack them straight on,” the LORD replied. “Instead, circle around behind and attack them near the poplar trees.","6":"David then led his men to Jerusalem to fight against the Jebusites, the original inhabitants of the land who were living there. The Jebusites taunted David, saying, “You’ll never get in here! Even the blind and lame could keep you out!” For the Jebusites thought they were safe.","4":"David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in all.","19":"So David asked the LORD, “Should I go out to fight the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?” The LORD replied to David, “Yes, go ahead. I will certainly hand them over to you.”","13":"After moving from Hebron to Jerusalem, David married more concubines and wives, and they had more sons and daughters."},"21":{"16":"Ishbi-benob was a descendant of the giants ; his bronze spearhead weighed more than seven pounds, and he was armed with a new sword. He had cornered David and was about to kill him.","3":"David asked them, “What can I do for you? How can I make amends so that you will bless the LORD’s people again?”","5":"Then they replied, “It was Saul who planned to destroy us, to keep us from having any place at all in the territory of Israel.","21":"But when he defied and taunted Israel, he was killed by Jonathan, the son of David’s brother Shimea.","18":"After this, there was another battle against the Philistines at Gob. As they fought, Sibbecai from Hushah killed Saph, another descendant of the giants.","12":"he went to the people of Jabesh-gilead and retrieved the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan. (When the Philistines had killed Saul and Jonathan on Mount Gilboa, the people of Jabesh-gilead stole their bodies from the public square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hung them.)","10":"Then Rizpah daughter of Aiah, the mother of two of the men, spread burlap on a rock and stayed there the entire harvest season. She prevented the scavenger birds from tearing at their bodies during the day and stopped wild animals from eating them at night.","2":"So the king summoned the Gibeonites. They were not part of Israel but were all that was left of the nation of the Amorites. The people of Israel had sworn not to kill them, but Saul, in his zeal for Israel and Judah, had tried to wipe them out.","22":"These four Philistines were descendants of the giants of Gath, but David and his warriors killed them.","8":"But he gave them Saul’s two sons Armoni and Mephibosheth, whose mother was Rizpah daughter of Aiah. He also gave them the five sons of Saul’s daughter Merab, the wife of Adriel son of Barzillai from Meholah.","17":"But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to David’s rescue and killed the Philistine. Then David’s men declared, “You are not going out to battle with us again! Why risk snuffing out the light of Israel?”","11":"When David learned what Rizpah, Saul’s concubine, had done,","1":"There was a famine during David’s reign that lasted for three years, so David asked the LORD about it. And the LORD said, “The famine has come because Saul and his family are guilty of murdering the Gibeonites.”","9":"The men of Gibeon executed them on the mountain before the LORD. So all seven of them died together at the beginning of the barley harvest.","14":"Then the king ordered that they bury the bones in the tomb of Kish, Saul’s father, at the town of Zela in the land of Benjamin. After that, God ended the famine in the land.","7":"The king spared Jonathan’s son Mephibosheth, who was Saul’s grandson, because of the oath David and Jonathan had sworn before the LORD.","15":"Once again the Philistines were at war with Israel. And when David and his men were in the thick of battle, David became weak and exhausted.","20":"In another battle with the Philistines at Gath, they encountered a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in all, who was also a descendant of the giants.","6":"So let seven of Saul’s sons be handed over to us, and we will execute them before the LORD at Gibeon, on the mountain of the LORD. ” “All right,” the king said, “I will do it.”","4":"“Well, money can’t settle this matter between us and the family of Saul,” the Gibeonites replied. “Neither can we demand the life of anyone in Israel.” “What can I do then?” David asked. “Just tell me and I will do it for you.”","19":"During another battle at Gob, Elhanan son of Jair from Bethlehem killed the brother of Goliath of Gath. The handle of his spear was as thick as a weaver’s beam!","13":"So David obtained the bones of Saul and Jonathan, as well as the bones of the men the Gibeonites had executed."},"18":{"11":"“What?” Joab demanded. “You saw him there and didn’t kill him? I would have rewarded you with ten pieces of silver and a hero’s belt!”","3":"But his men objected strongly. “You must not go,” they urged. “If we have to turn and run — and even if half of us die — it will make no difference to Absalom’s troops; they will be looking only for you. You are worth 10,000 of us, and it is better that you stay here in the town and send help if we need it.”","20":"“No,” Joab told him, “it wouldn’t be good news to the king that his son is dead. You can be my messenger another time, but not today.”","12":"“I would not kill the king’s son for even a thousand pieces of silver, ” the man replied to Joab. “We all heard the king say to you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘For my sake, please spare young Absalom.’","10":"One of David’s men saw what had happened and told Joab, “I saw Absalom dangling from a great tree.”","17":"They threw Absalom’s body into a deep pit in the forest and piled a great heap of stones over it. And all Israel fled to their homes.","13":"And if I had betrayed the king by killing his son — and the king would certainly find out who did it — you yourself would be the first to abandon me.”","27":"“The first man runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok,” the watchman said. “He is a good man and comes with good news,” the king replied.","30":"“Wait here,” the king told him. So Ahimaaz stepped aside.","18":"During his lifetime, Absalom had built a monument to himself in the King’s Valley, for he said, “I have no son to carry on my name.” He named the monument after himself, and it is known as Absalom’s Monument to this day.","29":"“What about young Absalom?” the king demanded. “Is he all right?” Ahimaaz replied, “When Joab told me to come, there was a lot of commotion. But I didn’t know what was happening.”","23":"“Yes, but let me go anyway,” he begged. Joab finally said, “All right, go ahead.” So Ahimaaz took the less demanding route by way of the plain and ran to Mahanaim ahead of the Ethiopian.","19":"Then Zadok’s son Ahimaaz said, “Let me run to the king with the good news that the LORD has rescued him from his enemies.”","1":"David now mustered the men who were with him and appointed generals and captains to lead them.","5":"And the king gave this command to Joab, Abishai, and Ittai: “For my sake, deal gently with young Absalom.” And all the troops heard the king give this order to his commanders.","4":"“If you think that’s the best plan, I’ll do it,” the king answered. So he stood alongside the gate of the town as all the troops marched out in groups of hundreds and of thousands.","8":"The battle raged all across the countryside, and more men died because of the forest than were killed by the sword.","26":"the watchman saw another man running toward them. He shouted down, “Here comes another one!” The king replied, “He also will have news.”","14":"“Enough of this nonsense,” Joab said. Then he took three daggers and plunged them into Absalom’s heart as he dangled, still alive, in the great tree.","22":"But Ahimaaz continued to plead with Joab, “Whatever happens, please let me go, too.” “Why should you go, my son?” Joab replied. “There will be no reward for your news.”","28":"Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king, “Everything is all right!” He bowed before the king with his face to the ground and said, “Praise to the LORD your God, who has handed over the rebels who dared to stand against my lord the king.”","25":"He shouted the news down to David, and the king replied, “If he is alone, he has news.” As the messenger came closer,","9":"During the battle, Absalom happened to come upon some of David’s men. He tried to escape on his mule, but as he rode beneath the thick branches of a great tree, his hair got caught in the tree. His mule kept going and left him dangling in the air.","33":"The king was overcome with emotion. He went up to the room over the gateway and burst into tears. And as he went, he cried, “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you! O Absalom, my son, my son.”","15":"Ten of Joab’s young armor bearers then surrounded Absalom and killed him.","21":"Then Joab said to a man from Ethiopia, “Go tell the king what you have seen.” The man bowed and ran off.","24":"While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the town, the watchman climbed to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked, he saw a lone man running toward them.","16":"Then Joab blew the ram’s horn, and his men returned from chasing the army of Israel.","32":"“What about young Absalom?” the king demanded. “Is he all right?” And the Ethiopian replied, “May all of your enemies, my lord the king, both now and in the future, share the fate of that young man!”","7":"and the Israelite troops were beaten back by David’s men. There was a great slaughter that day, and 20,000 men laid down their lives.","2":"He sent the troops out in three groups, placing one group under Joab, one under Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and one under Ittai, the man from Gath. The king told his troops, “I am going out with you.”","6":"So the battle began in the forest of Ephraim,","31":"Then the man from Ethiopia arrived and said, “I have good news for my lord the king. Today the LORD has rescued you from all those who rebelled against you.”"},"12":{"11":"“This is what the LORD says: Because of what you have done, I will cause your own household to rebel against you. I will give your wives to another man before your very eyes, and he will go to bed with them in public view.","3":"The poor man owned nothing but one little lamb he had bought. He raised that little lamb, and it grew up with his children. It ate from the man’s own plate and drank from his cup. He cuddled it in his arms like a baby daughter.","20":"Then David got up from the ground, washed himself, put on lotions, and changed his clothes. He went to the Tabernacle and worshiped the LORD. After that, he returned to the palace and was served food and ate.","12":"You did it secretly, but I will make this happen to you openly in the sight of all Israel.”","10":"From this time on, your family will live by the sword because you have despised me by taking Uriah’s wife to be your own.","17":"The elders of his household pleaded with him to get up and eat with them, but he refused.","13":"Then David confessed to Nathan, “I have sinned against the LORD.” Nathan replied, “Yes, but the LORD has forgiven you, and you won’t die for this sin.","27":"Joab sent messengers to tell David, “I have fought against Rabbah and captured its water supply.","30":"David removed the crown from the king’s head, and it was placed on his own head. The crown was made of gold and set with gems, and it weighed seventy-five pounds. David took a vast amount of plunder from the city.","18":"Then on the seventh day the child died. David’s advisers were afraid to tell him. “He wouldn’t listen to reason while the child was ill,” they said. “What drastic thing will he do when we tell him the child is dead?”","29":"So David gathered the rest of the army and went to Rabbah, and he fought against it and captured it.","23":"But why should I fast when he is dead? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him one day, but he cannot return to me.”","19":"When David saw them whispering, he realized what had happened. “Is the child dead?” he asked. “Yes,” they replied, “he is dead.”","1":"So the LORD sent Nathan the prophet to tell David this story: “There were two men in a certain town. One was rich, and one was poor.","5":"David was furious. “As surely as the LORD lives,” he vowed, “any man who would do such a thing deserves to die!","4":"One day a guest arrived at the home of the rich man. But instead of killing an animal from his own flock or herd, he took the poor man’s lamb and killed it and prepared it for his guest.”","8":"I gave you your master’s house and his wives and the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. And if that had not been enough, I would have given you much, much more.","26":"Meanwhile, Joab was fighting against Rabbah, the capital of Ammon, and he captured the royal fortifications.","14":"Nevertheless, because you have shown utter contempt for the word of the LORD by doing this, your child will die.”","22":"David replied, “I fasted and wept while the child was alive, for I said, ‘Perhaps the LORD will be gracious to me and let the child live.’","28":"Now bring the rest of the army and capture the city. Otherwise, I will capture it and get credit for the victory.”","25":"and sent word through Nathan the prophet that they should name him Jedidiah (which means “beloved of the LORD”), as the LORD had commanded.","9":"Why, then, have you despised the word of the LORD and done this horrible deed? For you have murdered Uriah the Hittite with the sword of the Ammonites and stolen his wife.","15":"After Nathan returned to his home, the LORD sent a deadly illness to the child of David and Uriah’s wife.","21":"His advisers were amazed. “We don’t understand you,” they told him. “While the child was still living, you wept and refused to eat. But now that the child is dead, you have stopped your mourning and are eating again.”","24":"Then David comforted Bathsheba, his wife, and slept with her. She became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and David named him Solomon. The LORD loved the child","16":"David begged God to spare the child. He went without food and lay all night on the bare ground.","7":"Then Nathan said to David, “You are that man! The LORD, the God of Israel, says: I anointed you king of Israel and saved you from the power of Saul.","2":"The rich man owned a great many sheep and cattle.","6":"He must repay four lambs to the poor man for the one he stole and for having no pity.”","31":"He also made slaves of the people of Rabbah and forced them to labor with saws, iron picks, and iron axes, and to work in the brick kilns. That is how he dealt with the people of all the Ammonite towns. Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem."},"10":{"16":"they were joined by additional Aramean troops summoned by Hadadezer from the other side of the Euphrates River. These troops arrived at Helam under the command of Shobach, the commander of Hadadezer’s forces.","3":"the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun, their master, “Do you really think these men are coming here to honor your father? No! David has sent them to spy out the city so they can come in and conquer it!”","5":"When David heard what had happened, he sent messengers to tell the men, “Stay at Jericho until your beards grow out, and then come back.” For they felt deep shame because of their appearance.","18":"But again the Arameans fled from the Israelites. This time David’s forces killed 700 charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers, including Shobach, the commander of their army.","12":"Be courageous! Let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. May the LORD’s will be done.”","10":"He left the rest of the army under the command of his brother Abishai, who was to attack the Ammonites.","2":"David said, “I am going to show loyalty to Hanun just as his father, Nahash, was always loyal to me.” So David sent ambassadors to express sympathy to Hanun about his father’s death. But when David’s ambassadors arrived in the land of Ammon,","8":"The Ammonite troops came out and drew up their battle lines at the entrance of the city gate, while the Arameans from Zobah and Rehob and the men from Tob and Maacah positioned themselves to fight in the open fields.","17":"When David heard what was happening, he mobilized all Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and led the army to Helam. The Arameans positioned themselves in battle formation and fought against David.","11":"“If the Arameans are too strong for me, then come over and help me,” Joab told his brother. “And if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I will come and help you.","1":"Some time after this, King Nahash of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun became king.","9":"When Joab saw that he would have to fight on both the front and the rear, he chose some of Israel’s elite troops and placed them under his personal command to fight the Arameans in the fields.","14":"And when the Ammonites saw the Arameans running, they ran from Abishai and retreated into the city. After the battle was over, Joab returned to Jerusalem.","7":"When David heard about this, he sent Joab and all his warriors to fight them.","15":"The Arameans now realized that they were no match for Israel. So when they regrouped,","6":"When the people of Ammon realized how seriously they had angered David, they sent and hired 20,000 Aramean foot soldiers from the lands of Beth-rehob and Zobah, 1,000 from the king of Maacah, and 12,000 from the land of Tob.","4":"So Hanun seized David’s ambassadors and shaved off half of each man’s beard, cut off their robes at the buttocks, and sent them back to David in shame.","19":"When all the kings allied with Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they surrendered to Israel and became their subjects. After that, the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites.","13":"When Joab and his troops attacked, the Arameans began to run away."},"2":{"11":"David made Hebron his capital, and he ruled as king of Judah for seven and a half years.","3":"and his men and their families all moved to Judah, and they settled in the villages near Hebron.","20":"When Abner looked back and saw him coming, he called out, “Is that you, Asahel?” “Yes, it is,” he replied.","12":"One day Abner led Ishbosheth’s troops from Mahanaim to Gibeon.","10":"Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he became king, and he ruled from Mahanaim for two years. Meanwhile, the people of Judah remained loyal to David.","17":"A fierce battle followed that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by the forces of David.","13":"About the same time, Joab son of Zeruiah led David’s troops out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. The two groups sat down there, facing each other from opposite sides of the pool.","27":"Then Joab said, “God only knows what would have happened if you hadn’t spoken, for we would have chased you all night if necessary.”","30":"Meanwhile, Joab and his men also returned home.

Yes, Joab sent me and told me what to say.","1":"Joab realized how much the king longed to see Absalom.","5":"“What’s the trouble?” the king asked. “Alas, I am a widow!” she replied. “My husband is dead.","4":"When the woman from Tekoa approached the king, she bowed with her face to the ground in deep respect and cried out, “O king! Help me!”","8":"“Leave it to me,” the king told her. “Go home, and I’ll see to it that no one touches him.”","26":"He cut his hair only once a year, and then only because it was so heavy. When he weighed it out, it came to five pounds!","14":"All of us must die eventually. Our lives are like water spilled out on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God does not just sweep life away; instead, he devises ways to bring us back when we have been separated from him.","22":"Joab bowed with his face to the ground in deep respect and said, “At last I know that I have gained your approval, my lord the king, for you have granted me this request!”","28":"Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years, but he never got to see the king.","25":"Now Absalom was praised as the most handsome man in all Israel. He was flawless from head to foot.","9":"“Oh, thank you, my lord the king,” the woman from Tekoa replied. “If you are criticized for helping me, let the blame fall on me and on my father’s house, and let the king and his throne be innocent.”","33":"So Joab told the king what Absalom had said. Then at last David summoned Absalom, who came and bowed low before the king, and the king kissed him.","15":"“I have come to plead with my lord the king because people have threatened me. I said to myself, ‘Perhaps the king will listen to me","21":"So the king sent for Joab and told him, “All right, go and bring back the young man Absalom.”","24":"But the king gave this order: “Absalom may go to his own house, but he must never come into my presence.” So Absalom did not see the king.","16":"and rescue us from those who would cut us off from the inheritance God has given us.","32":"And Absalom replied, “Because I wanted you to ask the king why he brought me back from Geshur if he didn’t intend to see me. I might as well have stayed there. Let me see the king; if he finds me guilty of anything, then let him kill me.”","7":"Now the rest of the family is demanding, ‘Let us have your son. We will execute him for murdering his brother. He doesn’t deserve to inherit his family’s property.’ They want to extinguish the only coal I have left, and my husband’s name and family will disappear from the face of the earth.”","2":"So he sent for a woman from Tekoa who had a reputation for great wisdom. He said to her, “Pretend you are in mourning; wear mourning clothes and don’t put on lotions. Act like a woman who has been mourning for the dead for a long time.","6":"My two sons had a fight out in the field. And since no one was there to stop it, one of them was killed.","31":"Then Joab came to Absalom at his house and demanded, “Why did your servants set my field on fire?”"},"7":{"11":"starting from the time I appointed judges to rule my people Israel.

I told him, ‘Saddle my donkey so I can go with the king.’ For as you know I am crippled.","39":"So all the people crossed the Jordan with the king. After David had blessed Barzillai and kissed him, Barzillai returned to his own home.","14":"Then Amasa convinced all the men of Judah, and they responded unanimously. They sent word to the king, “Return to us, and bring back all who are with you.”","37":"Then let me return again to die in my own town, where my father and mother are buried. But here is your servant, my son Kimham. Let him go with my lord the king and receive whatever you want to give him.”","22":"“Who asked your opinion, you sons of Zeruiah!” David exclaimed. “Why have you become my adversary today? This is not a day for execution, for today I am once again the king of Israel!”","28":"All my relatives and I could expect only death from you, my lord, but instead you have honored me by allowing me to eat at your own table! What more can I ask?”","25":"“Why didn’t you come with me, Mephibosheth?” the king asked him.","9":"And throughout all the tribes of Israel there was much discussion and argument going on. The people were saying, “The king rescued us from our enemies and saved us from the Philistines, but Absalom chased him out of the country.","33":"“Come across with me and live in Jerusalem,” the king said to Barzillai. “I will take care of you there.”","15":"So the king started back to Jerusalem. And when he arrived at the Jordan River, the people of Judah came to Gilgal to meet him and escort him across the river.","34":"“No,” he replied, “I am far too old to go with the king to Jerusalem.","21":"Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said, “Shimei should die, for he cursed the LORD’s anointed king!”","24":"Now Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson, came down from Jerusalem to meet the king. He had not cared for his feet, trimmed his beard, or washed his clothes since the day the king left Jerusalem.","16":"Shimei son of Gera, the man from Bahurim in Benjamin, hurried across with the men of Judah to welcome King David.","35":"I am eighty years old today, and I can no longer enjoy anything. Food and wine are no longer tasty, and I cannot hear the singers as they sing. I would only be a burden to my lord the king.","32":"He was very old — eighty years of age — and very wealthy. He was the one who had provided food for the king during his stay in Mahanaim.","7":"Now go out there and congratulate your troops, for I swear by the LORD that if you don’t go out, not a single one of them will remain here tonight. Then you will be worse off than ever before.”","43":"“But there are ten tribes in Israel,” the others replied. “So we have ten times as much right to the king as you do. What right do you have to treat us with such contempt? Weren’t we the first to speak of bringing him back to be our king again?” The argument continued back and forth, and the men of Judah spoke even more harshly than the men of Israel.","2":"As all the people heard of the king’s deep grief for his son, the joy of that day’s victory was turned into deep sadness.","38":"“Good,” the king agreed. “Kimham will go with me, and I will help him in any way you would like. And I will do for you anything you want.”","6":"You seem to love those who hate you and hate those who love you. You have made it clear today that your commanders and troops mean nothing to you. It seems that if Absalom had lived and all of us had died, you would be pleased.","31":"Barzillai of Gilead had come down from Rogelim to escort the king across the Jordan."},"13":{"11":"But as she was feeding him, he grabbed her and demanded, “Come to bed with me, my darling sister.”","3":"But Amnon had a very crafty friend — his cousin Jonadab. He was the son of David’s brother Shimea.","20":"Her brother Absalom saw her and asked, “Is it true that Amnon has been with you? Well, my sister, keep quiet for now, since he’s your brother. Don’t you worry about it.” So Tamar lived as a desolate woman in her brother Absalom’s house.","12":"“No, my brother!” she cried. “Don’t be foolish! Don’t do this to me! Such wicked things aren’t done in Israel.","10":"Then he said to Tamar, “Now bring the food into my bedroom and feed it to me here.” So Tamar took his favorite dish to him.","17":"He shouted for his servant and demanded, “Throw this woman out, and lock the door behind her!”","13":"Where could I go in my shame? And you would be called one of the greatest fools in Israel. Please, just speak to the king about it, and he will let you marry me.”","27":"But Absalom kept on pressing the king until he finally agreed to let all his sons attend, including Amnon. So Absalom prepared a feast fit for a king.","30":"As they were on the way back to Jerusalem, this report reached David: “Absalom has killed all the king’s sons; not one is left alive!”","18":"So the servant put her out and locked the door behind her. She was wearing a long, beautiful robe, as was the custom in those days for the king’s virgin daughters.","36":"They soon arrived, weeping and sobbing, and the king and all his servants wept bitterly with them.","29":"So at Absalom’s signal they murdered Amnon. Then the other sons of the king jumped on their mules and fled.","23":"Two years later, when Absalom’s sheep were being sheared at Baal-hazor near Ephraim, Absalom invited all the king’s sons to come to a feast.","19":"But now Tamar tore her robe and put ashes on her head. And then, with her face in her hands, she went away crying.","1":"Now David’s son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar. And Amnon, her half brother, fell desperately in love with her.","5":"“Well,” Jonadab said, “I’ll tell you what to do. Go back to bed and pretend you are ill. When your father comes to see you, ask him to let Tamar come and prepare some food for you. Tell him you’ll feel better if she prepares it as you watch and feeds you with her own hands.”","4":"One day Jonadab said to Amnon, “What’s the trouble? Why should the son of a king look so dejected morning after morning?” So Amnon told him, “I am in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”","8":"When Tamar arrived at Amnon’s house, she went to the place where he was lying down so he could watch her mix some dough. Then she baked his favorite dish for him.","26":"“Well, then,” Absalom said, “if you can’t come, how about sending my brother Amnon with us?” “Why Amnon?” the king asked.","39":"And King David, now reconciled to Amnon’s death, longed to be reunited with his son Absalom.","14":"But Amnon wouldn’t listen to her, and since he was stronger than she was, he raped her.","37":"And David mourned many days for his son Amnon. Absalom fled to his grandfather, Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur.","22":"And though Absalom never spoke to Amnon about this, he hated Amnon deeply because of what he had done to his sister.","28":"Absalom told his men, “Wait until Amnon gets drunk; then at my signal, kill him! Don’t be afraid. I’m the one who has given the command. Take courage and do it!”","25":"The king replied, “No, my son. If we all came, we would be too much of a burden on you.” Absalom pressed him, but the king would not come, though he gave Absalom his blessing.","9":"But when she set the serving tray before him, he refused to eat. “Everyone get out of here,” Amnon told his servants. So they all left.","33":"No, my lord the king, your sons aren’t all dead! It was only Amnon.”","15":"Then suddenly Amnon’s love turned to hate, and he hated her even more than he had loved her. “Get out of here!” he snarled at her.","34":"Meanwhile Absalom escaped. Then the watchman on the Jerusalem wall saw a great crowd coming down the hill on the road from the west. He ran to tell the king, “I see a crowd of people coming from the Horonaim road along the side of the hill.”","21":"When King David heard what had happened, he was very angry.","24":"He went to the king and said, “My sheep-shearers are now at work. Would the king and his servants please come to celebrate the occasion with me?”","16":"“No, no!” Tamar cried. “Sending me away now is worse than what you’ve already done to me.” But Amnon wouldn’t listen to her.","35":"“Look!” Jonadab told the king. “There they are now! The king’s sons are coming, just as I said.”","32":"But just then Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimea, arrived and said, “No, don’t believe that all the king’s sons have been killed! It was only Amnon! Absalom has been plotting this ever since Amnon raped his sister Tamar.","7":"So David agreed and sent Tamar to Amnon’s house to prepare some food for him.","2":"Amnon became so obsessed with Tamar that he became ill. She was a virgin, and Amnon thought he could never have her.","38":"He stayed there in Geshur for three years.","6":"So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. And when the king came to see him, Amnon asked him, “Please let my sister Tamar come and cook my favorite dish as I watch. Then I can eat it from her own hands.”","31":"The king got up, tore his robe, and threw himself on the ground. His advisers also tore their clothes in horror and sorrow."}}}
