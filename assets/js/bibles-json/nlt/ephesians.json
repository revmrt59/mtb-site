Amen.","18":"And may you have the power to understand, as all God’s people should, how wide, how long, how high, and how deep his love is.","12":"Because of Christ and our faith in him, we can now come boldly and confidently into God’s presence.","10":"God’s purpose in all this was to use the church to display his wisdom in its rich variety to all the unseen rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.","2":"assuming, by the way, that you know God gave me the special responsibility of extending his grace to you Gentiles.","8":"Though I am the least deserving of all God’s people, he graciously gave me the privilege of telling the Gentiles about the endless treasures available to them in Christ.","17":"Then Christ will make his home in your hearts as you trust in him. Your roots will grow down into God’s love and keep you strong.","11":"This was his eternal plan, which he carried out through Christ Jesus our Lord.","1":"When I think of all this, I, Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus for the benefit of you Gentiles . . .","9":"I was chosen to explain to everyone this mysterious plan that God, the Creator of all things, had kept secret from the beginning.","14":"When I think of all this, I fall to my knees and pray to the Father,","7":"By God’s grace and mighty power, I have been given the privilege of serving him by spreading this Good News.","15":"the Creator of everything in heaven and on earth.","20":"Now all glory to God, who is able, through his mighty power at work within us, to accomplish infinitely more than we might ask or think.","6":"And this is God’s plan: Both Gentiles and Jews who believe the Good News share equally in the riches inherited by God’s children. Both are part of the same body, and both enjoy the promise of blessings because they belong to Christ Jesus.","4":"As you read what I have written, you will understand my insight into this plan regarding Christ.","19":"May you experience the love of Christ, though it is too great to understand fully. Then you will be made complete with all the fullness of life and power that comes from God.","13":"So please don’t lose heart because of my trials here. I am suffering for you, so you should feel honored."},"2":{"16":"Together as one body, Christ reconciled both groups to God by means of his death on the cross, and our hostility toward each other was put to death.","3":"All of us used to live that way, following the passionate desires and inclinations of our sinful nature. By our very nature we were subject to God’s anger, just like everyone else.","5":"that even though we were dead because of our sins, he gave us life when he raised Christ from the dead. (It is only by God’s grace that you have been saved!)","21":"We are carefully joined together in him, becoming a holy temple for the Lord.","18":"Now all of us can come to the Father through the same Holy Spirit because of what Christ has done for us.","12":"In those days you were living apart from Christ. You were excluded from citizenship among the people of Israel, and you did not know the covenant promises God had made to them. You lived in this world without God and without hope.","10":"For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.","2":"You used to live in sin, just like the rest of the world, obeying the devil — the commander of the powers in the unseen world. He is the spirit at work in the hearts of those who refuse to obey God.","22":"Through him you Gentiles are also being made part of this dwelling where God lives by his Spirit.","8":"God saved you by his grace when you believed. And you can’t take credit for this; it is a gift from God.","17":"He brought this Good News of peace to you Gentiles who were far away from him, and peace to the Jews who were near.","11":"Don’t forget that you Gentiles used to be outsiders. You were called “uncircumcised heathens” by the Jews, who were proud of their circumcision, even though it affected only their bodies and not their hearts.","1":"Once you were dead because of your disobedience and your many sins.","9":"Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it.","14":"For Christ himself has brought peace to us. He united Jews and Gentiles into one people when, in his own body on the cross, he broke down the wall of hostility that separated us.","7":"So God can point to us in all future ages as examples of the incredible wealth of his grace and kindness toward us, as shown in all he has done for us who are united with Christ Jesus.","15":"He did this by ending the system of law with its commandments and regulations. He made peace between Jews and Gentiles by creating in himself one new people from the two groups.","20":"Together, we are his house, built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets. And the cornerstone is Christ Jesus himself.","6":"For he raised us from the dead along with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ Jesus.","4":"But God is so rich in mercy, and he loved us so much,","19":"So now you Gentiles are no longer strangers and foreigners. You are citizens along with all of God’s holy people. You are members of God’s family.","13":"But now you have been united with Christ Jesus. Once you were far away from God, but now you have been brought near to him through the blood of Christ."},"1":{"16":"I have not stopped thanking God for you. I pray for you constantly,","3":"All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ.","5":"God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure.","21":"Now he is far above any ruler or authority or power or leader or anything else — not only in this world but also in the world to come.","18":"I pray that your hearts will be flooded with light so that you can understand the confident hope he has given to those he called — his holy people who are his rich and glorious inheritance.","12":"God’s purpose was that we Jews who were the first to trust in Christ would bring praise and glory to God.","10":"And this is the plan: At the right time he will bring everything together under the authority of Christ — everything in heaven and on earth.","2":"May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.","22":"God has put all things under the authority of Christ and has made him head over all things for the benefit of the church.","8":"He has showered his kindness on us, along with all wisdom and understanding.","17":"asking God, the glorious Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to give you spiritual wisdom and insight so that you might grow in your knowledge of God.","11":"Furthermore, because we are united with Christ, we have received an inheritance from God, for he chose us in advance, and he makes everything work out according to his plan.","1":"This letter is from Paul, chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus. I am writing to God’s holy people in Ephesus, who are faithful followers of Christ Jesus.","9":"God has now revealed to us his mysterious will regarding Christ — which is to fulfill his own good plan.","14":"The Spirit is God’s guarantee that he will give us the inheritance he promised and that he has purchased us to be his own people. He did this so we would praise and glorify him.","7":"He is so rich in kindness and grace that he purchased our freedom with the blood of his Son and forgave our sins.","15":"Ever since I first heard of your strong faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for God’s people everywhere,","20":"that raised Christ from the dead and seated him in the place of honor at God’s right hand in the heavenly realms.","23":"And the church is his body; it is made full and complete by Christ, who fills all things everywhere with himself.","6":"So we praise God for the glorious grace he has poured out on us who belong to his dear Son.","4":"Even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes.","19":"I also pray that you will understand the incredible greatness of God’s power for us who believe him. This is the same mighty power","13":"And now you Gentiles have also heard the truth, the Good News that God saves you. And when you believed in Christ, he identified you as his own by giving you the Holy Spirit, whom he promised long ago."},"4":{"11":"Now these are the gifts Christ gave to the church: the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the pastors and teachers.","3":"Make every effort to keep yourselves united in the Spirit, binding yourselves together with peace.","20":"But that isn’t what you learned about Christ.","12":"Their responsibility is to equip God’s people to do his work and build up the church, the body of Christ.","10":"And the same one who descended is the one who ascended higher than all the heavens, so that he might fill the entire universe with himself.","17":"With the Lord’s authority I say this: Live no longer as the Gentiles do, for they are hopelessly confused.","13":"This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God’s Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ.","27":"for anger gives a foothold to the devil.","30":"And do not bring sorrow to God’s Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, he has identified you as his own, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption.","18":"Their minds are full of darkness; they wander far from the life God gives because they have closed their minds and hardened their hearts against him.","29":"Don’t use foul or abusive language. Let everything you say be good and helpful, so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them.","23":"Instead, let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes.","19":"They have no sense of shame. They live for lustful pleasure and eagerly practice every kind of impurity.","1":"Therefore I, a prisoner for serving the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of your calling, for you have been called by God.","5":"There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism,","4":"For there is one body and one Spirit, just as you have been called to one glorious hope for the future.","8":"That is why the Scriptures say, “When he ascended to the heights,he led a crowd of captivesand gave gifts to his people.”","26":"And “don’t sin by letting anger control you.” Don’t let the sun go down while you are still angry,","14":"Then we will no longer be immature like children. We won’t be tossed and blown about by every wind of new teaching. We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like the truth.","22":"throw off your old sinful nature and your former way of life, which is corrupted by lust and deception.","28":"If you are a thief, quit stealing. Instead, use your hands for good hard work, and then give generously to others in need.","25":"So stop telling lies. Let us tell our neighbors the truth, for we are all parts of the same body.","9":"Notice that it says “he ascended.” This clearly means that Christ also descended to our lowly world.","15":"Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the church.","21":"Since you have heard about Jesus and have learned the truth that comes from him,","24":"Put on your new nature, created to be like God — truly righteous and holy.","16":"He makes the whole body fit together perfectly. As each part does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow, so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love.","32":"Instead, be kind to each other, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.","7":"However, he has given each one of us a special gift through the generosity of Christ.","2":"Always be humble and gentle. Be patient with each other, making allowance for each other’s faults because of your love.","6":"one God and Father of all,who is over all, in all, and living through all.","31":"Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of evil behavior."},"6":{"16":"In addition to all of these, hold up the shield of faith to stop the fiery arrows of the devil.","3":"If you honor your father and mother, “things will go well for you, and you will have a long life on the earth.”","5":"Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear. Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ.","21":"To bring you up to date, Tychicus will give you a full report about what I am doing and how I am getting along. He is a beloved brother and faithful helper in the Lord’s work.","18":"Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion. Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all believers everywhere.","12":"For we are not fighting against flesh-and-blood enemies, but against evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against mighty powers in this dark world, and against evil spirits in the heavenly places.","10":"A final word: Be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.","2":"“Honor your father and mother.” This is the first commandment with a promise:","22":"I have sent him to you for this very purpose — to let you know how we are doing and to encourage you.","8":"Remember that the Lord will reward each one of us for the good we do, whether we are slaves or free.","17":"Put on salvation as your helmet, and take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.","11":"Put on all of God’s armor so that you will be able to stand firm against all strategies of the devil.","1":"Children, obey your parents because you belong to the Lord, for this is the right thing to do.","9":"Masters, treat your slaves in the same way.

So pray that I will keep on speaking boldly for him, as I should.","23":"Peace be with you, dear brothers and sisters, and may God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you love with faithfulness.","6":"Try to please them all the time, not just when they are watching you. As slaves of Christ, do the will of God with all your heart.","4":"Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger by the way you treat them. Rather, bring them up with the discipline and instruction that comes from the Lord.","19":"And pray for me, too. Ask God to give me the right words so I can boldly explain God’s mysterious plan that the Good News is for Jews and Gentiles alike.","13":"Therefore, put on every piece of God’s armor so you will be able to resist the enemy in the time of evil. Then after the battle you will still be standing firm."},"5":{"11":"Take no part in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness; instead, expose them.","3":"Let there be no sexual immorality, impurity, or greed among you. Such sins have no place among God’s people.","20":"And give thanks for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.","12":"It is shameful even to talk about the things that ungodly people do in secret.","10":"Carefully determine what pleases the Lord.","17":"Don’t act thoughtlessly, but understand what the Lord wants you to do.","13":"But their evil intentions will be exposed when the light shines on them,","27":"He did this to present her to himself as a glorious church without a spot or wrinkle or any other blemish.
