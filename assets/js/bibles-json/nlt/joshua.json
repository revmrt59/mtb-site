No one has the courage to fight after hearing such things.

To this day we are not fully cleansed of it, even after the plague that struck the entire community of the LORD.","13":"First, however, they sent a delegation led by Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, to talk with the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.","27":"but as a memorial.

If you rebel against the LORD today, he will be angry with all of us tomorrow.","29":"Far be it from us to rebel against the LORD or turn away from him by building our own altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, or sacrifices. Only the altar of the LORD our God that stands in front of the Tabernacle may be used for that purpose.”","23":"If we have built an altar for ourselves to turn away from the LORD or to offer burnt offerings or grain offerings or peace offerings, may the LORD himself punish us.","19":"“If you need the altar because the land you possess is defiled, then join us in the LORD’s land, where the Tabernacle of the LORD is situated, and share our land with us.

The LORD, the Mighty One, is God! He knows the truth, and may Israel know it, too! We have not built the altar in treacherous rebellion against the LORD. If we have done so, do not spare our lives this day.","28":"“If they say this, our descendants can reply, ‘Look at this copy of the LORD’s altar that our ancestors made. It is not for burnt offerings or sacrifices; it is a reminder of the relationship both of us have with the LORD.’","25":"The LORD has placed the Jordan River as a barrier between our people and you people of Reuben and Gad. You have no claim to the LORD.’ So your descendants may prevent our descendants from worshiping the LORD.","9":"So the men of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the rest of Israel at Shiloh in the land of Canaan. They started the journey back to their own land of Gilead, the territory that belonged to them according to the LORD’s command through Moses.","33":"And all the Israelites were satisfied and praised God and spoke no more of war against Reuben and Gad.","15":"When they arrived in the land of Gilead, they said to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,","34":"The people of Reuben and Gad named the altar “Witness,” for they said, “It is a witness between us and them that the LORD is our God, too.”","21":"Then the people of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered the heads of the clans of Israel:","24":"“The truth is, we have built this altar because we fear that in the future your descendants will say to ours, ‘What right do you have to worship the LORD, the God of Israel?","16":"“The whole community of the LORD demands to know why you are betraying the God of Israel. How could you turn away from the LORD and build an altar for yourselves in rebellion against him?","32":"Then Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, and the other leaders left the tribes of Reuben and Gad in Gilead and returned to the land of Canaan to tell the Israelites what had happened.","7":"Moses had given the land of Bashan, east of the Jordan River, to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (The other half of the tribe was given land west of the Jordan.) As Joshua sent them away and blessed them,","2":"He told them, “You have done as Moses, the servant of the LORD, commanded you, and you have obeyed every order I have given you.","6":"So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went home.","31":"Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, replied to them, “Today we know the LORD is among us because you have not committed this treachery against the LORD as we thought. Instead, you have rescued Israel from being destroyed by the hand of the LORD.”"},"8":{"11":"All the fighting men who were with Joshua marched in front of the town and camped on the north side of Ai, with a valley between them and the town.","3":"So Joshua and all the fighting men set out to attack Ai. Joshua chose 30,000 of his best warriors and sent them out at night","20":"When the men of Ai looked behind them, smoke from the town was filling the sky, and they had nowhere to go. For the Israelites who had fled in the direction of the wilderness now turned on their pursuers.","12":"That night Joshua sent about 5,000 men to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the town.","10":"Early the next morning Joshua roused his men and started toward Ai, accompanied by the elders of Israel.","17":"There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who did not chase after the Israelites, and the town was left wide open.","13":"So they stationed the main army north of the town and the ambush west of the town. Joshua himself spent that night in the valley.","27":"Only the livestock and the treasures of the town were not destroyed, for the Israelites kept these as plunder for themselves, as the LORD had commanded Joshua.","30":"Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal.","18":"Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Point the spear in your hand toward Ai, for I will hand the town over to you.” Joshua did as he was commanded.","29":"Joshua impaled the king of Ai on a sharpened pole and left him there until evening. At sunset the Israelites took down the body, as Joshua commanded, and threw it in front of the town gate. They piled a great heap of stones over him that can still be seen today.","23":"Only the king of Ai was taken alive and brought to Joshua.","19":"As soon as Joshua gave this signal, all the men in ambush jumped up from their position and poured into the town. They quickly captured it and set it on fire.","1":"Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid or discouraged. Take all your fighting men and attack Ai, for I have given you the king of Ai, his people, his town, and his land.","5":"When our main army attacks, the men of Ai will come out to fight as they did before, and we will run away from them.","4":"with these orders: “Hide in ambush close behind the town and be ready for action.","8":"Set the town on fire, as the LORD has commanded. You have your orders.”","26":"For Joshua kept holding out his spear until everyone who had lived in Ai was completely destroyed.","14":"When the king of Ai saw the Israelites across the valley, he and all his army hurried out early in the morning and attacked the Israelites at a place overlooking the Jordan Valley. But he didn’t realize there was an ambush behind the town.","22":"Meanwhile, the Israelites who were inside the town came out and attacked the enemy from the rear. So the men of Ai were caught in the middle, with Israelite fighters on both sides. Israel attacked them, and not a single person survived or escaped.","28":"So Joshua burned the town of Ai, and it became a permanent mound of ruins, desolate to this very day.","25":"So the entire population of Ai, including men and women, was wiped out that day — 12,000 in all.","9":"So they left and went to the place of ambush between Bethel and the west side of Ai. But Joshua remained among the people in the camp that night.","33":"Then all the Israelites — foreigners and native-born alike — along with the elders, officers, and judges, were divided into two groups. One group stood in front of Mount Gerizim, the other in front of Mount Ebal. Each group faced the other, and between them stood the Levitical priests carrying the Ark of the LORD’s Covenant. This was all done according to the commands that Moses, the servant of the LORD, had previously given for blessing the people of Israel.","15":"Joshua and the Israelite army fled toward the wilderness as though they were badly beaten.","34":"Joshua then read to them all the blessings and curses Moses had written in the Book of Instruction.","21":"When Joshua and all the other Israelites saw that the ambush had succeeded and that smoke was rising from the town, they turned and attacked the men of Ai.","24":"When the Israelite army finished chasing and killing all the men of Ai in the open fields, they went back and finished off everyone inside.","16":"Then all the men in the town were called out to chase after them. In this way, they were lured away from the town.","35":"Every word of every command that Moses had ever given was read to the entire assembly of Israel, including the women and children and the foreigners who lived among them.","32":"And as the Israelites watched, Joshua copied onto the stones of the altar the instructions Moses had given them.","7":"you will jump up from your ambush and take possession of the town, for the LORD your God will give it to you.","2":"You will destroy them as you destroyed Jericho and its king. But this time you may keep the plunder and the livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the town.”","6":"We will let them chase us until we have drawn them away from the town. For they will say, ‘The Israelites are running away from us as they did before.’ Then, while we are running from them,","31":"He followed the commands that Moses the LORD’s servant had written in the Book of Instruction: “Make me an altar from stones that are uncut and have not been shaped with iron tools.” Then on the altar they presented burnt offerings and peace offerings to the LORD."},"17":{"16":"The descendants of Joseph responded, “It’s true that the hill country is not large enough for us. But all the Canaanites in the lowlands have iron chariots, both those in Beth-shan and its surrounding settlements and those in the valley of Jezreel. They are too strong for us.”","3":"However, Zelophehad, a descendant of Hepher son of Gilead, son of Makir, son of Manasseh, had no sons. He had only daughters, whose names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.","5":"As a result, Manasseh’s total allocation came to ten parcels of land, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan across the Jordan River,","18":"The forests of the hill country will be yours as well. Clear as much of the land as you wish, and take possession of its farthest corners. And you will drive out the Canaanites from the valleys, too, even though they are strong and have iron chariots.”","12":"But the descendants of Manasseh were unable to occupy these towns because the Canaanites were determined to stay in that region.","10":"In general, however, the land south of the ravine belonged to Ephraim, and the land north of the ravine belonged to Manasseh. Manasseh’s boundary ran along the northern side of the ravine and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. North of Manasseh was the territory of Asher, and to the east was the territory of Issachar.","2":"So the allotment on the west side of the Jordan was for the remaining families within the clans of the tribe of Manasseh: Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These clans represent the male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph.","8":"The land surrounding Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but the town of Tappuah itself, on the border of Manasseh’s territory, belonged to the tribe of Ephraim.","17":"Then Joshua said to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, the descendants of Joseph, “Since you are so large and strong, you will be given more than one portion.","11":"The following towns within the territory of Issachar and Asher, however, were given to Manasseh: Beth-shan, Ibleam, Dor (that is, Naphoth-dor), Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo, each with their surrounding settlements.","1":"The next allotment of land was given to the half-tribe of Manasseh, the descendants of Joseph’s older son. Makir, the firstborn son of Manasseh, was the father of Gilead. Because his descendants were experienced soldiers, the regions of Gilead and Bashan on the east side of the Jordan had already been given to them.","9":"From the spring of Tappuah, the boundary of Manasseh followed the Kanah Ravine to the Mediterranean Sea. Several towns south of the ravine were inside Manasseh’s territory, but they actually belonged to the tribe of Ephraim.","14":"The descendants of Joseph came to Joshua and asked, “Why have you given us only one portion of land as our homeland when the LORD has blessed us with so many people?”","7":"The boundary of the tribe of Manasseh extended from the border of Asher to Micmethath, near Shechem. Then the boundary went south from Micmethath to the settlement near the spring of Tappuah.","15":"Joshua replied, “If there are so many of you, and if the hill country of Ephraim is not large enough for you, clear out land for yourselves in the forest where the Perizzites and Rephaites live.”","6":"because the female descendants of Manasseh received a grant of land along with the male descendants. (The land of Gilead was given to the rest of the male descendants of Manasseh.)","4":"These women came to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the Israelite leaders and said, “The LORD commanded Moses to give us a grant of land along with the men of our tribe.” So Joshua gave them a grant of land along with their uncles, as the LORD had commanded.","13":"Later, however, when the Israelites became strong enough, they forced the Canaanites to work as slaves. But they did not drive them out of the land."},"11":{"16":"So Joshua conquered the entire region — the hill country, the entire Negev, the whole area around the town of Goshen, the western foothills, the Jordan Valley, the mountains of Israel, and the Galilean foothills.","3":"the kings of Canaan, both east and west; the kings of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites in the hill country, and the Hivites in the towns on the slopes of Mount Hermon in the land of Mizpah.","5":"The kings joined forces and established their camp around the water near Merom to fight against Israel.","21":"During this period Joshua destroyed all the descendants of Anak, who lived in the hill country of Hebron, Debir, Anab, and the entire hill country of Judah and Israel. He killed them all and completely destroyed their towns.","18":"waging war for a long time to accomplish this.","12":"Joshua slaughtered all the other kings and their people, completely destroying them, just as Moses, the servant of the LORD, had commanded.","10":"Joshua then turned back and captured Hazor and killed its king. (Hazor had at one time been the capital of all these kingdoms.)","2":"all the kings of the northern hill country; the kings in the Jordan Valley south of Galilee ; the kings in the Galilean foothills ; the kings of Naphoth-dor on the west;","22":"None of the descendants of Anak were left in all the land of Israel, though some still remained in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod.","8":"And the LORD gave them victory over their enemies. The Israelites chased them as far as Greater Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, and eastward into the valley of Mizpah, until not one enemy warrior was left alive.","17":"The Israelite territory now extended all the way from Mount Halak, which leads up to Seir in the south, as far north as Baal-gad at the foot of Mount Hermon in the valley of Lebanon. Joshua killed all the kings of those territories,","11":"The Israelites completely destroyed every living thing in the city, leaving no survivors. Not a single person was spared. And then Joshua burned the city.","1":"When King Jabin of Hazor heard what had happened, he sent messages to the following kings: King Jobab of Madon; the king of Shimron; the king of Acshaph;","9":"Then Joshua crippled the horses and burned all the chariots, as the LORD had instructed.","14":"And the Israelites took all the plunder and livestock of the ravaged towns for themselves. But they killed all the people, leaving no survivors.","7":"So Joshua and all his fighting men traveled to the water near Merom and attacked suddenly.","15":"As the LORD had commanded his servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua. And Joshua did as he was told, carefully obeying all the commands that the LORD had given to Moses.","20":"For the LORD hardened their hearts and caused them to fight the Israelites. So they were completely destroyed without mercy, as the LORD had commanded Moses.","23":"So Joshua took control of the entire land, just as the LORD had instructed Moses. He gave it to the people of Israel as their special possession, dividing the land among the tribes. So the land finally had rest from war.","6":"Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them. By this time tomorrow I will hand all of them over to Israel as dead men. Then you must cripple their horses and burn their chariots.”","4":"All these kings came out to fight. Their combined armies formed a vast horde. And with all their horses and chariots, they covered the landscape like the sand on the seashore.","19":"No one in this region made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites of Gibeon. All the others were defeated.","13":"But the Israelites did not burn any of the towns built on mounds except Hazor, which Joshua burned."},"1":{"16":"They answered Joshua, “We will do whatever you command us, and we will go wherever you send us.","3":"I promise you what I promised Moses: ‘Wherever you set foot, you will be on land I have given you —","5":"No one will be able to stand against you as long as you live. For I will be with you as I was with Moses. I will not fail you or abandon you.","18":"Anyone who rebels against your orders and does not obey your words and everything you command will be put to death. So be strong and courageous!”","12":"Then Joshua called together the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. He told them,","10":"Joshua then commanded the officers of Israel,","2":"“Moses my servant is dead. Therefore, the time has come for you to lead these people, the Israelites, across the Jordan River into the land I am giving them.","8":"Study this Book of Instruction continually. Meditate on it day and night so you will be sure to obey everything written in it. Only then will you prosper and succeed in all you do.","17":"We will obey you just as we obeyed Moses. And may the LORD your God be with you as he was with Moses.","11":"“Go through the camp and tell the people to get their provisions ready. In three days you will cross the Jordan River and take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving you.”","1":"After the death of Moses the LORD’s servant, the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ assistant. He said,","9":"This is my command — be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid or discouraged. For the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.”","14":"Your wives, children, and livestock may remain here in the land Moses assigned to you on the east side of the Jordan River. But your strong warriors, fully armed, must lead the other tribes across the Jordan to help them conquer their territory. Stay with them","7":"Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the instructions Moses gave you. Do not deviate from them, turning either to the right or to the left. Then you will be successful in everything you do.","15":"until the LORD gives them rest, as he has given you rest, and until they, too, possess the land the LORD your God is giving them. Only then may you return and settle here on the east side of the Jordan River in the land that Moses, the servant of the LORD, assigned to you.”","6":"“Be strong and courageous, for you are the one who will lead these people to possess all the land I swore to their ancestors I would give them.","4":"from the Negev wilderness in the south to the Lebanon mountains in the north, from the Euphrates River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, including all the land of the Hittites.’","13":"“Remember what Moses, the servant of the LORD, commanded you: ‘The LORD your God is giving you a place of rest. He has given you this land.’"},"9":{"11":"So our elders and all our people instructed us, ‘Take supplies for a long journey. Go meet with the people of Israel and tell them, “We are your servants; please make a treaty with us.”’","3":"But when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,","20":"This is what we must do. We must let them live, for divine anger would come upon us if we broke our oath.","12":"“This bread was hot from the ovens when we left our homes. But now, as you can see, it is dry and moldy.","10":"We have also heard what he did to the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River — King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan (who lived in Ashtaroth).","17":"The Israelites set out at once to investigate and reached their towns in three days. The names of these towns were Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.","13":"These wineskins were new when we filled them, but now they are old and split open. And our clothing and sandals are worn out from our very long journey.”","27":"But that day he made the Gibeonites the woodcutters and water carriers for the community of Israel and for the altar of the LORD — wherever the LORD would choose to build it. And that is what they do to this day.","18":"But the Israelites did not attack the towns, for the Israelite leaders had made a vow to them in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. The people of Israel grumbled against their leaders because of the treaty.","23":"May you be cursed! From now on you will always be servants who cut wood and carry water for the house of my God.”","19":"But the leaders replied, “Since we have sworn an oath in the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel, we cannot touch them.","1":"Now all the kings west of the Jordan River heard about what had happened. These were the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who lived in the hill country, in the western foothills, and along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea as far north as the Lebanon mountains.","5":"They put on worn-out, patched sandals and ragged clothes. And the bread they took with them was dry and moldy.","4":"they resorted to deception to save themselves. They sent ambassadors to Joshua, loading their donkeys with weathered saddlebags and old, patched wineskins.","8":"They replied, “We are your servants.” “But who are you?” Joshua demanded. “Where do you come from?”","26":"So Joshua did not allow the people of Israel to kill them.","14":"So the Israelites examined their food, but they did not consult the LORD.","22":"Joshua called together the Gibeonites and said, “Why did you lie to us? Why did you say that you live in a distant land when you live right here among us?","25":"Now we are at your mercy — do to us whatever you think is right.”","9":"They answered, “Your servants have come from a very distant country. We have heard of the might of the LORD your God and of all he did in Egypt.","15":"Then Joshua made a peace treaty with them and guaranteed their safety, and the leaders of the community ratified their agreement with a binding oath.","21":"Let them live.” So they made them woodcutters and water carriers for the entire community, as the Israelite leaders directed.","24":"They replied, “We did it because we — your servants — were clearly told that the LORD your God commanded his servant Moses to give you this entire land and to destroy all the people living in it. So we feared greatly for our lives because of you. That is why we have done this.","16":"Three days after making the treaty, they learned that these people actually lived nearby!","7":"The Israelites replied to these Hivites, “How do we know you don’t live nearby? For if you do, we cannot make a treaty with you.”","2":"These kings combined their armies to fight as one against Joshua and the Israelites.","6":"When they arrived at the camp of Israel at Gilgal, they told Joshua and the men of Israel, “We have come from a distant land to ask you to make a peace treaty with us.”"},"24":{"11":"“When you crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho, the men of Jericho fought against you, as did the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I gave you victory over them.","3":"But I took your ancestor Abraham from the land beyond the Euphrates and led him into the land of Canaan. I gave him many descendants through his son Isaac.","20":"If you abandon the LORD and serve other gods, he will turn against you and destroy you, even though he has been so good to you.”","12":"And I sent terror ahead of you to drive out the two kings of the Amorites. It was not your swords or bows that brought you victory.","10":"but I would not listen to him. Instead, I made Balaam bless you, and so I rescued you from Balak.","17":"For the LORD our God is the one who rescued us and our ancestors from slavery in the land of Egypt. He performed mighty miracles before our very eyes. As we traveled through the wilderness among our enemies, he preserved us.","13":"I gave you land you had not worked on, and I gave you towns you did not build — the towns where you are now living. I gave you vineyards and olive groves for food, though you did not plant them.","27":"Joshua said to all the people, “This stone has heard everything the LORD said to us. It will be a witness to testify against you if you go back on your word to God.”","30":"They buried him in the land he had been allocated, at Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.","18":"It was the LORD who drove out the Amorites and the other nations living here in the land. So we, too, will serve the LORD, for he alone is our God.”","29":"After this, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of 110.","23":"“All right then,” Joshua said, “destroy the idols among you, and turn your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel.”","19":"Then Joshua warned the people, “You are not able to serve the LORD, for he is a holy and jealous God. He will not forgive your rebellion and your sins.","1":"Then Joshua summoned all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, including their elders, leaders, judges, and officers. So they came and presented themselves to God.","5":"“Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I brought terrible plagues on Egypt; and afterward I brought you out as a free people.","4":"To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave the mountains of Seir, while Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.","8":"“Finally, I brought you into the land of the Amorites on the east side of the Jordan. They fought against you, but I destroyed them before you. I gave you victory over them, and you took possession of their land.","26":"Joshua recorded these things in the Book of God’s Instructions. As a reminder of their agreement, he took a huge stone and rolled it beneath the terebinth tree beside the Tabernacle of the LORD.","14":"“So fear the LORD and serve him wholeheartedly. Put away forever the idols your ancestors worshiped when they lived beyond the Euphrates River and in Egypt. Serve the LORD alone.","22":"“You are a witness to your own decision,” Joshua said. “You have chosen to serve the LORD.” “Yes,” they replied, “we are witnesses to what we have said.”","28":"Then Joshua sent all the people away to their own homelands.","25":"So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day at Shechem, committing them to follow the decrees and regulations of the LORD.","9":"Then Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, started a war against Israel. He summoned Balaam son of Beor to curse you,","33":"Eleazar son of Aaron also died. He was buried in the hill country of Ephraim, in the town of Gibeah, which had been given to his son Phinehas.","15":"But if you refuse to serve the LORD, then choose today whom you will serve. Would you prefer the gods your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates? Or will it be the gods of the Amorites in whose land you now live? But as for me and my family, we will serve the LORD.”","21":"But the people answered Joshua, “No, we will serve the LORD!”","24":"The people said to Joshua, “We will serve the LORD our God. We will obey him alone.”","16":"The people replied, “We would never abandon the LORD and serve other gods.","32":"The bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had brought along with them when they left Egypt, were buried at Shechem, in the plot of land Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor for 100 pieces of silver. This land was located in the territory allotted to the descendants of Joseph.","7":"When your ancestors cried out to the LORD, I put darkness between you and the Egyptians. I brought the sea crashing down on the Egyptians, drowning them. With your very own eyes you saw what I did. Then you lived in the wilderness for many years.","2":"Joshua said to the people, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Long ago your ancestors, including Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the Euphrates River, and they worshiped other gods.","6":"But when your ancestors arrived at the Red Sea, the Egyptians chased after you with chariots and charioteers.","31":"The people of Israel served the LORD throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him — those who had personally experienced all that the LORD had done for Israel."},"14":{"3":"Moses had already given a grant of land to the two and a half tribes on the east side of the Jordan River, but he had given the Levites no such allotment.","5":"So the land was distributed in strict accordance with the LORD’s commands to Moses.","12":"So give me the hill country that the LORD promised me. You will remember that as scouts we found the descendants of Anak living there in great, walled towns. But if the LORD is with me, I will drive them out of the land, just as the LORD said.”","10":"“Now, as you can see, the LORD has kept me alive and well as he promised for all these forty-five years since Moses made this promise — even while Israel wandered in the wilderness. Today I am eighty-five years old.","2":"These nine and a half tribes received their grants of land by means of sacred lots, in accordance with the LORD’s command through Moses.","8":"but my brothers who went with me frightened the people from entering the Promised Land. For my part, I wholeheartedly followed the LORD my God.","11":"I am as strong now as I was when Moses sent me on that journey, and I can still travel and fight as well as I could then.","1":"The remaining tribes of Israel received land in Canaan as allotted by Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the tribal leaders.","9":"So that day Moses solemnly promised me, ‘The land of Canaan on which you were just walking will be your grant of land and that of your descendants forever, because you wholeheartedly followed the LORD my God.’","14":"Hebron still belongs to the descendants of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite because he wholeheartedly followed the LORD, the God of Israel.","7":"I was forty years old when Moses, the servant of the LORD, sent me from Kadesh-barnea to explore the land of Canaan. I returned and gave an honest report,","15":"(Previously Hebron had been called Kiriath-arba. It had been named after Arba, a great hero of the descendants of Anak.) And the land had rest from war.","6":"A delegation from the tribe of Judah, led by Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, came to Joshua at Gilgal. Caleb said to Joshua, “Remember what the LORD said to Moses, the man of God, about you and me when we were at Kadesh-barnea.","4":"The descendants of Joseph had become two separate tribes — Manasseh and Ephraim. And the Levites were given no land at all, only towns to live in with surrounding pasturelands for their livestock and all their possessions.","13":"So Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave Hebron to him as his portion of land."},"7":{"16":"Early the next morning Joshua brought the tribes of Israel before the LORD, and the tribe of Judah was singled out.","3":"When they returned, they told Joshua, “There’s no need for all of us to go up there; it won’t take more than two or three thousand men to attack Ai. Since there are so few of them, don’t make all our people struggle to go up there.”","5":"chased the Israelites from the town gate as far as the quarries, and they killed about thirty-six who were retreating down the slope. The Israelites were paralyzed with fear at this turn of events, and their courage melted away.","21":"Among the plunder I saw a beautiful robe from Babylon, 200 silver coins, and a bar of gold weighing more than a pound. I wanted them so much that I took them. They are hidden in the ground beneath my tent, with the silver buried deeper than the rest.”","18":"Every member of Zimri’s family was brought forward person by person, and Achan was singled out.","12":"That is why the Israelites are running from their enemies in defeat. For now Israel itself has been set apart for destruction. I will not remain with you any longer unless you destroy the things among you that were set apart for destruction.","10":"But the LORD said to Joshua, “Get up! Why are you lying on your face like this?","2":"Joshua sent some of his men from Jericho to spy out the town of Ai, east of Bethel, near Beth-aven.","22":"So Joshua sent some men to make a search. They ran to the tent and found the stolen goods hidden there, just as Achan had said, with the silver buried beneath the rest.","8":"Lord, what can I say now that Israel has fled from its enemies?","17":"Then the clans of Judah came forward, and the clan of Zerah was singled out. Then the families of Zerah came forward, and the family of Zimri was singled out.","11":"Israel has sinned and broken my covenant! They have stolen some of the things that I commanded must be set apart for me. And they have not only stolen them but have lied about it and hidden the things among their own belongings.","1":"But Israel violated the instructions about the things set apart for the LORD.
