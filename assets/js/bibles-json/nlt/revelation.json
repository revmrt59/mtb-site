They also represent seven kings.","14":"Together they will go to war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will defeat them because he is Lord of all lords and King of all kings. And his called and chosen and faithful ones will be with him.”","7":"“Why are you so amazed?” the angel asked. “I will tell you the mystery of this woman and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns on which she sits.","15":"Then the angel said to me, “The waters where the prostitute is ruling represent masses of people of every nation and language.","6":"I could see that she was drunk — drunk with the blood of God’s holy people who were witnesses for Jesus. I stared at her in complete amazement.","4":"The woman wore purple and scarlet clothing and beautiful jewelry made of gold and precious gems and pearls. In her hand she held a gold goblet full of obscenities and the impurities of her immorality.","13":"They will all agree to give him their power and authority."},"11":{"16":"The twenty-four elders sitting on their thrones before God fell with their faces to the ground and worshiped him.","3":"And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will be clothed in burlap and will prophesy during those 1,260 days.”","5":"If anyone tries to harm them, fire flashes from their mouths and consumes their enemies. This is how anyone who tries to harm them must die.","18":"The nations were filled with wrath,but now the time of your wrath has come.It is time to judge the deadand reward your servants the prophets,as well as your holy people,and all who fear your name,from the least to the greatest.It is time to destroyall who have caused destruction on the earth.”","12":"Then a loud voice from heaven called to the two prophets, “Come up here!” And they rose to heaven in a cloud as their enemies watched.","10":"All the people who belong to this world will gloat over them and give presents to each other to celebrate the death of the two prophets who had tormented them.","2":"But do not measure the outer courtyard, for it has been turned over to the nations. They will trample the holy city for 42 months.","8":"And their bodies will lie in the main street of Jerusalem, the city that is figuratively called “Sodom” and “Egypt,” the city where their Lord was crucified.","17":"And they said, “We give thanks to you, Lord God, the Almighty,the one who is and who always was,for now you have assumed your great powerand have begun to reign.","11":"But after three and a half days, God breathed life into them, and they stood up! Terror struck all who were staring at them.","1":"Then I was given a measuring stick, and I was told, “Go and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count the number of worshipers.","9":"And for three and a half days, all peoples, tribes, languages, and nations will stare at their bodies. No one will be allowed to bury them.","14":"The second terror is past, but look, the third terror is coming quickly.","7":"When they complete their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the bottomless pit will declare war against them, and he will conquer them and kill them.","15":"Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices shouting in heaven: “The world has now become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ,and he will reign forever and ever.”","6":"They have power to shut the sky so that no rain will fall for as long as they prophesy. And they have the power to turn the rivers and oceans into blood, and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they wish.","4":"These two prophets are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of all the earth.","19":"Then, in heaven, the Temple of God was opened and the Ark of his covenant could be seen inside the Temple. Lightning flashed, thunder crashed and roared, and there was an earthquake and a terrible hailstorm.","13":"At the same time there was a terrible earthquake that destroyed a tenth of the city. Seven thousand people died in that earthquake, and everyone else was terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven."},"1":{"16":"He held seven stars in his right hand, and a sharp two-edged sword came from his mouth.

He sent an angel to present this revelation to his servant John,","9":"I, John, am your brother and your partner in suffering and in God’s Kingdom and in the patient endurance to which Jesus calls us. I was exiled to the island of Patmos for preaching the word of God and for my testimony about Jesus.","14":"His head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow. And his eyes were like flames of fire.","7":"Look! He comes with the clouds of heaven.And everyone will see him —even those who pierced him.And all the nations of the worldwill mourn for him.Yes! Amen!","15":"His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace, and his voice thundered like mighty ocean waves.","20":"This is the meaning of the mystery of the seven stars you saw in my right hand and the seven gold lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.","6":"He has made us a Kingdom of priests for God his Father.

He was wearing a long robe with a gold sash across his chest."},"9":{"16":"I heard the size of their army, which was 200 million mounted troops.","3":"Then locusts came from the smoke and descended on the earth, and they were given power to sting like scorpions.","5":"They were told not to kill them but to torture them for five months with pain like the pain of a scorpion sting.","21":"And they did not repent of their murders or their witchcraft or their sexual immorality or their thefts.","18":"One-third of all the people on earth were killed by these three plagues — by the fire and smoke and burning sulfur that came from the mouths of the horses.","12":"The first terror is past, but look, two more terrors are coming!","10":"They had tails that stung like scorpions, and for five months they had the power to torment people.","2":"When he opened it, smoke poured out as though from a huge furnace, and the sunlight and air turned dark from the smoke.","8":"They had hair like women’s hair and teeth like the teeth of a lion.","17":"And in my vision, I saw the horses and the riders sitting on them. The riders wore armor that was fiery red and dark blue and yellow. The horses had heads like lions, and fire and smoke and burning sulfur billowed from their mouths.","11":"Their king is the angel from the bottomless pit; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon — the Destroyer.","1":"Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen to earth from the sky, and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit.","9":"They wore armor made of iron, and their wings roared like an army of chariots rushing into battle.","14":"And the voice said to the sixth angel who held the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great Euphrates River.”","7":"The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. They had what looked like gold crowns on their heads, and their faces looked like human faces.","15":"Then the four angels who had been prepared for this hour and day and month and year were turned loose to kill one-third of all the people on earth.","20":"But the people who did not die in these plagues still refused to repent of their evil deeds and turn to God.

They will long to die, but death will flee from them!","4":"They were told not to harm the grass or plants or trees, but only the people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.","19":"Their power was in their mouths and in their tails.

He shouted to the angel with the sharp sickle, “Swing your sickle now to gather the clusters of grapes from the vines of the earth, for they are ripe for judgment.”","12":"This means that God’s holy people must endure persecution patiently, obeying his commands and maintaining their faith in Jesus.","10":"must drink the wine of God’s anger. It has been poured full strength into God’s cup of wrath.

Where did they come from?”"},"15":{"7":"Then one of the four living beings handed each of the seven angels a gold bowl filled with the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.","3":"And they were singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb: “Great and marvelous are your works,O Lord God, the Almighty.Just and true are your ways,O King of the nations.","2":"I saw before me what seemed to be a glass sea mixed with fire.

This means that God’s holy people must endure persecution patiently and remain faithful.","2":"This beast looked like a leopard, but it had the feet of a bear and the mouth of a lion!
