A dumb donkey spoke with a man’s voice and put a stop to the prophet’s madness.","3":"In their greed they will exploit you with false words. Their judgment from long ago is not idle, and their destruction does not slumber.","5":"He did not spare the ancient world. He preserved only Noah, a proclaimer of righteousness, along with seven others, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly.","21":"For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than after learning about it, to turn back from the holy commandment passed on to them.","18":"For by mouthing grandiosities that amount to nothing, they entice in sensual fleshly passions those who are barely escaping from those who live in error.","12":"But these people are like irrational animals — creatures of instinct born to be captured and killed.
