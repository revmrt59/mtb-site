How can Jacob stand, for he is small?”","12":"Then Amaziah said to Amos: “Seer, go away! Flee back to the land of Judah. Eat bread there, and prophesy there.","10":"Then Amaziah, the priest of Beth-el, sent word to King Jeroboam of Israel, saying: “Amos has been conspiring against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land cannot endure all his words.","2":"When the locust-swarm had finished devouring the vegetation of the land, I said: “ADONAI Elohim, please pardon! How can Jacob stand, for he is small?”","8":"Then ADONAI said to me: “What do you see, Amos?” I said: “A plumb line.” Then my Lord said: “Behold, I am setting a plumb line among My people Israel — I will no longer pass over them.","17":"Therefore, this is what ADONAI says: ‘Your wife shall become a prostitute in the city, your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword, and your land divided up by a measuring line. Now, as for you — you will die in an unclean land, and Israel will surely be led away captive out of its land.’”","11":"For this is what Amos has said: ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely go captive from his land.’”","1":"This is what my Lord ADONAI has shown me: Behold, He was forming locusts at the beginning of the spring crop — after the cutting of the king’s hay.","9":"So the high places of Isaac will become desolate, the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste, and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.”","14":"So Amos responded and said to Amaziah: “I am no prophet, nor am I a son of a prophet. Rather, I am a shepherd tending fig trees.","7":"This is what He has revealed to me: Behold, my Lord was standing by a vertical wall, and in His hand was a plumb line.","15":"But ADONAI took me from following the flock and ADONAI said to me: ‘Go, prophesy to My people Israel.’","6":"ADONAI relented concerning this. “This also shall not happen,” says my Lord ADONAI.","4":"This is what my Lord ADONAI has shown me: Behold, ADONAI Elohim was calling for the trial by fire, and it would have devoured the great deep, and it would have devoured the territory.","13":"But at Bethel you are not to prophesy any more — for it is a royal sanctuary and a house of the kingdom.”"},"9":{"3":"If they should hide themselves at the top of Carmel, I will search them out and take them from there. If they hide themselves from My eyes at the bottom of the sea, from there I will command the sea serpent to bite them.","5":"My Lord is ADONAI-Tzva’ot. It is He who touches the land so it melts, and all its inhabitants will mourn. Then it will surge like all the Nile, and sink again like the Nile of Egypt.","12":"— so they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations called by My Name.” It is a declaration of ADONAI, the One who will do this.","10":"By the sword shall all the sinners of My people die, those who say: ‘The calamity will not overtake or confront us.’","2":"If they should dig down to Sheol, from there My hand will take them.

I will restore its breaches, raise up its ruins, and rebuild it as in days of old","1":"I saw my Lord standing by the altar, and He said: “Strike the tops of the pillars, so the porches shake! Break all of them off at the head! Then the last of them I will slay with the sword — none of them fleeing will escape and no fugitive will slip away.","9":"“For behold, I have commanded, and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations, like grain being tossed in a sieve, without a pebble falling to the ground.","14":"Yes, I will restore the captivity of My people Israel.

They will also make gardens and eat their fruit.","7":"“Are you not like the children of the Cushites to Me, Bnei-Yisrael?” It is the declaration of ADONAI. “Did I not bring Israel up from the land of Egypt, the Philistines from Caphtor, and Aram from Kir?”","15":"Yes, I will plant them on their land, and they will never again be plucked up out of their land that I have given to them.” ADONAI, your God, has said it.","6":"He who builds His upper stories in heaven fitted its vault over the earth. He who summons the waters of the sea and pours them out on the face of the earth — ADONAI is His Name.","4":"If they should go into captivity before their enemies, from there I will command the sword to slay them. I will set My eyes upon them for calamity and not for prosperity.”","13":"“Behold, days are soon coming” — it is a declaration of ADONAI — “when the plowman will overtake the reaper and the one treading grapes, the one sowing seed. The mountains will drip sweet wine and all the hills will melt over."},"3":{"3":"Can two walk together unless they meet by appointment?","5":"Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground if it has no bait?

Your citadels will be plundered","1":"Hear this word that ADONAI has spoken against you, Bnei Yisrael, against the whole family that I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying:","9":"Proclaim on the citadels in Ashdod and the citadels in the land of Egypt: “Assemble on Samaria’s mountains: Behold the great tumult within it, even the oppression within it.”","14":"“For in a day I shall punish Israel for the transgressions of Israel, and attend to the altars of Bethel — the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground.","7":"For the Lord ADONAI, will do nothing, unless He has revealed His counsel to His servants the prophets.","15":"I will also strike the winter house together with the summer house. The houses of ivory will perish, and great houses will be demolished.” It is the declaration of ADONAI.","6":"If a shofar alarm sounds in a city, will people not tremble? If there is calamity in a city, has not ADONAI caused it?","4":"Does a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey? Does a young lion growl from his den unless he has taken prey?","13":"Hear, and testify against the house of Jacob.” It is the declaration of my Lord ADONAI Elohei-Tzva’ot."},"2":{"16":"The valiant among the warriors will flee naked in that day.” declares ADONAI.","3":"I will cut off the ruler from her midst, and slay all her princes with him.

Moab will die in an uproar, with a shout of alarm and the sound of the shofar.","8":"Upon garments taken in pledge they stretch out beside every altar, and drink wine confiscated as fines in the house of their gods.","11":"I raised up prophets from your sons and Nazirites from your young men. Is this not so, Bnei Yisrael?” declares ADONAI.","1":"Thus says ADONAI: For three crimes of Moab even for four, I will not relent. For he burned the bones of Edom’s king to lime,","9":"“I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like cedars and as strong as oaks — yes, I destroyed his fruit from above and his roots from beneath.","14":"Then flight will fail for the swift. The mighty will not strengthen his power, The warrior will not save his life.","7":"They trample the head of the poor into the dust of the earth and thwart the way of the humble. A man and his father go to the same girl,  to profane My holy Name.","15":"The archer will not stand, the fleet-footed will not escape, the horseman will not save himself.","6":"Thus says ADONAI: “For three crimes of Israel even for four, I will not relent. For they sell the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes.","4":"Thus says ADONAI: “For three crimes of Judah even for four, I will not relent.
