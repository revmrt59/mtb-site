Indeed, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh’s servants and in the eyes of the people.","2":"Speak now into the ears of the people, and let every man ask from his neighbor and every woman from her neighbor for articles of silver and gold.”","1":"Now ADONAI had said to Moses, “I will bring one more plague upon Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will surely thrust you out altogether from here.","4":"So Moses said, “This is what ADONAI says: At around midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt,","6":"There will be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, the likes of which has never been before nor will ever be again.","5":"and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt will die — from the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the maidservant behind the mill, along with all the firstborn cattle.","8":"All these servants of yours will come down to me and bow down to me, saying, ‘Get out, you and all the people who follow you!’ After that, I will go.” Then he went out from Pharaoh hot with anger."},"3":{"16":"“Go now, gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them: ‘ADONAI, the God of your fathers — the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob — has appeared to me, saying, I have been paying close attention to you and have seen what is done to you in Egypt.","3":"Moses thought, “I will go now, and see this great sight. Why is the bush not burnt?”","5":"Then He said, “Come no closer. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.”","21":"“Then I shall grant these people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. So it will happen that when you go, you will not leave empty-handed.","18":"“They will listen to your voice. So you will go, you along with the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and say to him: ‘ADONAI, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness, so that we may sacrifice to ADONAI our God.’","12":"So He said, “I will surely be with you. So that will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you. When you have brought the people out of Egypt: you will worship God on this mountain.”","10":"Come now, I will send you to Pharaoh, so that you may bring My people Bnei-Yisrael out from Egypt.”","2":"Then the angel of ADONAI appeared to him in a flame of fire from within a bush. So he looked and saw the bush burning with fire, yet it was not consumed.","22":"Every woman is to ask her neighbor and the woman who lives in her house for silver and gold jewelry and clothing. You will put them on your sons and your daughters. So you will plunder the Egyptians.”","8":"So I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, to bring them up out of that land into a good and large land, a land flowing with milk and honey, into the place of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.","17":"So I promise I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt, into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.’","11":"But Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring Bnei-Yisrael out of Egypt?”","1":"Now Moses was tending the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. So he led the flock to the farthest end of the wilderness, coming to the mountain of God, Horeb.","9":"Now behold, the cry of Bnei-Yisrael has come to Me. Moreover I have seen the oppression that the Egyptians have inflicted on them.","14":"God answered Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. ” Then He said, “You are to say to Bnei-Yisrael, ‘I AM’ has sent me to you.”","7":"Then ADONAI said, “I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their slave masters, for I know their pains.","15":"God also said to Moses: “You are to say to Bnei-Yisrael, ADONAI, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My Name forever, and the Name by which I should be remembered from generation to generation.","20":"So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders that I will do in the midst of it. After that, he will let you go.","6":"Moreover He said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.” So Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.","4":"When ADONAI saw that he turned to look, He called to him out of the midst of the bush and said, “Moses, Moses!” So he answered, “Hineni.”","19":"Nevertheless, I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, except by a mighty hand.","13":"But Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to Bnei-Yisrael and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is His Name?’ What should I say to them?”"},"20":{"16":"“Do not bear false witness against your neighbor.","3":"“You shall have no other gods before Me.","5":"Do not bow down to them, do not let anyone make you serve them. For I, ADONAI your God, am a jealous God, bringing the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,","21":"The people stood far off, while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.","18":"All the people witnessed the thundering and the lightning, and the sound of the shofar, and the mountain smoking. When the people saw it, they trembled and stood far off.","12":"“Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long upon the land which ADONAI your God is giving you.","10":"but the seventh day is a Shabbat to ADONAI your God. In it you shall not do any work — not you, nor your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, your cattle, nor the outsider that is within your gates.","2":"“I am ADONAI your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.","22":"Then ADONAI said to Moses, “Say this to Bnei-Yisrael: You yourselves have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven.","8":"“Remember Yom Shabbat, to keep it holy.","17":"“Do not covet your neighbor’s house, your neighbor’s wife, his manservant, his maidservant, his ox, his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor’s.”","11":"For in six days ADONAI made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Thus ADONAI blessed Yom Shabbat, and made it holy.","1":"Then God spoke all these words saying,","9":"You are to work six days, and do all your work,","24":"You are to make an altar of earth for Me, and there you will sacrifice your burnt offerings, your fellowship offerings — your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I cause My name to be mentioned I will come to you and bless you.","14":"“Do not commit adultery.","7":"“You must not take the Name of ADONAI your God in vain, for ADONAI will not hold him guiltless that takes His Name in vain.","15":"“Do not steal.","20":"So Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid, for God has come to test you, so that His fear may be in you, so that you do not sin.”","25":"When you make for Me an altar of stones, do not build it from cut stone, for if you use a tool on it, you will have profaned it.","23":"Do not make gods of silver alongside Me, and do not make gods of gold for yourselves.","6":"but showing lovingkindness to the thousands of generations of those who love Me and keep My mitzvot.","4":"Do not make for yourself a graven image , or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or on the earth below or in the water under the earth.","19":"So they said to Moses, “You, speak to us, and we will listen, but do not let God speak to us, or we will die.”","13":"“Do not murder.","26":"Nor are you to go up to My altar on steps, so that your nakedness would not be uncovered while on it.”"},"12":{"11":"Also you are to eat it this way: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand. You are to eat it in haste. It is ADONAI’s Passover.","41":"So it happened at the end of 430 years, to the very day, that all the armies of ADONAI went out from the land of Egypt.","45":"Nor should a visitor or hired servant eat it.","42":"It was a night of watching for ADONAI to bring them out of the land of Egypt. This same night is a night of vigil for ADONAI, for all Bnei-Yisrael throughout their generations.","3":"Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month, each man is to take a lamb for his family one lamb for the household.","20":"You are to eat no hametz; in all your houses you are to eat matzot.”","12":"“For I will go through the land of Egypt on that night and strike down every firstborn, both men and animals, and I will execute judgments against all the gods of Egypt. I am ADONAI.","10":"So let nothing of it remain until the morning. Whatever remains until the morning you are to burn with fire.","17":"So you are to observe the Feast of Matzot, for on this very same day have I brought your ranks out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you are to observe this day throughout your generations as an eternal ordinance.","51":"It was on that very day that ADONAI brought Bnei-Yisrael out of the land of Egypt as armies.","44":"but every man’s servant that is bought for money, after you have circumcised him, may eat it.","40":"Now the time that Bnei-Yisrael lived in Egypt was 430 years.","13":"The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are.  When I see the blood, I will pass over you. So there will be no plague among you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.","27":"You are to say, ‘It is the sacrifice of ADONAI’s Passover, because He passed over the houses of Bnei-Yisrael in Egypt, when He struck down the Egyptians, but spared our households.’” So the people bowed their heads and worshipped.","30":"Then Pharaoh rose up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians, and there was loud wailing in Egypt. For there was not a house where someone was not dead.","18":"During the first month in the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, you are to eat matzot, until the evening of the twenty-first day of the month.","36":"ADONAI gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians and let them have what they asked for. So they plundered the Egyptians.","29":"So it came about at midnight that ADONAI struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn cattle.","23":"ADONAI will pass through to strike down the Egyptians, but when He sees the blood on the crossbeam and the two doorposts, ADONAI will pass over that door, and will not allow the destroyer to come into your houses to strike you down.","19":"For seven days no hametz is to be found in your houses, for whoever eats hametz, that soul will be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is an outsider or one who is born in the land.","1":"Now ADONAI spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying,","47":"All the congregation of Israel must keep it.","5":"Your lamb is to be without blemish, a year old male.  You may take it from the sheep or from the goats.","49":"The same Torah applies to the native as well as the outsider who dwells among you.”","4":"But if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his nearest neighbor are to take one according to the number of the people. According to each person eating, you are to make your count for the lamb.","8":"They are to eat the meat that night, roasted over a fire. With matzot and bitter herbs  they are to eat it.","26":"Now when it happens that your children ask you, ‘What does this ceremony mean to you?’","39":"They had baked matzot cakes from the dough that they brought out of Egypt. It had no hametz, because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not delay, so they had not made provisions for themselves.","14":"“This day is to be a memorial for you.  You are to keep it as a feast to ADONAI. Throughout your generations you are to keep it as an eternal ordinance.","37":"Then Bnei-Yisrael journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about 600,000 men on foot, as well as children.","22":"You are to take a bundle of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and apply it to the crossbeam and two doorposts with the blood from the basin. None of you may go out the door of his house until morning.","28":"Then Bnei-Yisrael went and did it. They did just as ADONAI had commanded Moses and Aaron.","25":"“When you come into the land which ADONAI will give you as He has promised, you are to keep this ceremony.","9":"Do not eat any of it raw or boiled with water, but only roasted with fire — its head with its legs and its innards.","33":"Now the Egyptians urged the people, sending them out of the land quickly, for they thought, “We will all be dead!”","15":"For seven days you are to eat matzot, but on the first day you must remove hametz from your houses,  for whoever eats hametz from the first day until the seventh day, that soul will be cut off from Israel.","34":"So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.","21":"Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go, select lambs for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb.","24":"Also you are to observe this event as an eternal ordinance, for you and your children.","46":"It is to be eaten inside a single house. You are not to carry the meat out of the house, nor are you to break any of its bones.","16":"The first day is to be a holy assembly for you as well as the seventh day. No manner of work is to be done on those days, except what is to be eaten by every person — that alone may be prepared by you.","35":"So Bnei-Yisrael acted according to the word of Moses. They asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold, and for clothing.","32":"Take your flocks and your herds, as you said, and be gone! But bless me, too.”","7":"They are to take the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the crossbeam of the houses where they will eat it.","43":"Then ADONAI said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the ordinance of the Passover. No foreigner may eat it,","48":"But if an outsider dwells with you, who would keep the Passover for ADONAI, all his males must be circumcised. Then let him draw near and keep it. He will be like one who is native to the land. But no uncircumcised person may eat from it.","2":"“This month will mark the beginning of months for you; it is to be the first month of the year for you.","38":"Also a mixed multitude went up with them, along with the flocks, herds and heavy livestock.","50":"So all Bnei-Yisrael did so. They did just as ADONAI commanded Moses and Aaron.","6":"You must watch over it until the fourteenth day of the same month. Then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel is to slaughter it at twilight.","31":"So he called for Moses and Aaron at night and said, “Rise up, go out from my people, both you and Bnei-Yisrael, go, serve ADONAI as you have said."},"10":{"11":"Not so! Go now — the men — and serve ADONAI! For that’s what you were seeking.” Then they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.","3":"So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “This is what ADONAI, the God of the Hebrews, says: How long would you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, so they may serve Me.","20":"But ADONAI hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let Bnei-Yisrael go.","12":"Then ADONAI said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, so they may come up onto Egypt and eat every plant in the land — everything the hail has left.”","10":"But he said to them, “So may ADONAI be with you, if I ever do let you go, with your little ones. See clearly now! Evil is in your face.","17":"Now forgive my sin, only this once, please! So pray to ADONAI your God — just so He would take this death away from me!”","13":"So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and ADONAI brought an east wind over the land all that day and all night. When it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.","27":"But ADONAI hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was unwilling to let them go.","18":"So he went out from Pharaoh and prayed to ADONAI.","29":"“Right!” Moses said. “You said it! May I never see your face again!”","23":"They could not see one another, nor could anyone rise from his place for three days. Yet all Bnei-Yisrael had light within their dwellings.","19":"Then ADONAI turned the wind from the west, very strong, and it carried off the locusts and drove them into the Sea of Reeds. Not one locust remained in all the territory of Egypt.","1":"Then ADONAI said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, because I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, so that I might show these My signs in their midst,","5":"Then they will cover the face of the earth, so that no one will be able to see the ground. They will eat the remainder of what escaped — whatever is left from the hail — and eat every tree that grows for you out in the field.","4":"Or else, if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your borders.","8":"So Moses and Aaron were brought to Pharaoh again. “Go, serve ADONAI your God,” he said. “But who will be going?”","26":"Our cattle must also go with us — not a hoof may be left behind. We must take from them to serve ADONAI our God. We ourselves will not know how we will serve ADONAI until we arrive there.”","14":"The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and rested on the entire territory of Egypt. So dense — there was nothing like it before them, nor will there ever be again.","22":"So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.","28":"So Pharaoh said to him, “Go away from me! Take heed never to see my face again, because on the day you do, you will die!”","25":"But Moses said, “You must also put sacrifices and burnt offerings into our hand, then we will do it for ADONAI our God.","9":"Moses answered, “We will go with our young and our elderly, our sons and our daughters. We will go with our flocks and our herds — for we must have ADONAI’s feast for Him.”","15":"For they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land was darkened, and they ate every plant in the land and all the fruit from the trees that the hail had left. No green thing remained, not a tree or a plant of the field throughout all the land of Egypt.","21":"Then ADONAI said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven, and there will be darkness over the land of Egypt — a darkness that may be felt.”","24":"Pharaoh called Moses and said, “Go, serve ADONAI. Only let your flocks and your herds remain. Your little ones may also go with you.”","16":"Then Pharaoh quickly called for Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against ADONAI your God and against you.","7":"Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Send the men, so they may serve ADONAI their God. Don’t you realize yet that Egypt is being destroyed?”","2":"and so you may tell your son and your grandchildren what I have done in Egypt, as well as My signs that I did among them, so you may know that I am ADONAI.”","6":"Your houses will be filled, as will the houses of all your servants and the houses of all the Egyptians, as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen since the day they were on the earth until today!” Then he turned and went out from Pharaoh."},"17":{"16":"Then he said, “By the hand upon the throne of ADONAI, ADONAI will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.”","3":"But the people thirsted for water there, and they complained against Moses and said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt? To kill us with thirst, along with our children and cattle?”","5":"ADONAI said to Moses, “Walk before the people, and take of the elders of Israel with you, along with your staff with which you struck the river. Take it in your hand and go.","12":"Moses’ hands grew heavy, so they took a stone, put it under him, and he sat down. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on each side. So his hands were steady until the sun went down.","10":"So Joshua did as Moses said, and fought the Amalekites, while Moses, Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill.","2":"So the people quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.” And Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test ADONAI?”","8":"Then the Amalekites came and fought with Israel at Rephidim.","11":"When Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed. But when he let down his hand, the Amalekites prevailed.","1":"All the congregation of Bnei-Yisrael journeyed from the wilderness of Sin in stages, according to the command of ADONAI, and camped in Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.","9":"Moses said to Joshua, “Choose men, go out, and fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.”","14":"ADONAI said to Moses, “Write this for a memorial in the book, and rehearse it in the hearing of Joshua, for I will utterly blot out the memory of the Amalekites from under heaven.”","7":"The name of the place was called Massah and Meribah, because of the quarreling of Bnei-Yisrael, and because they tested ADONAI saying, “Is ADONAI among us, or not?”","15":"Then Moses built an altar, and called the name of it ADONAI-Nissi.","6":"Behold, I will stand before you, there upon the rock in Horeb. You are to strike the rock, and water will come out of it so that the people can drink.” Then Moses did just so in the eyes of the elders of Israel.","4":"So Moses cried out to ADONAI saying, “What am I to do for these people? They are about ready to stone me.”","13":"So Joshua overpowered the Amalekites and his army with the edge of the sword."},"40":{"11":"Then you are to anoint the basin along with its base and sanctify it.","3":"You are to put the Ark of the Testimony there, and screen off the Ark with the curtain.","20":"He placed the Testimony into the Ark, set the poles on the Ark, and put the atonement cover on top of the Ark.","12":"“Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and wash them with water.","10":"Also you are to anoint the altar of burnt offering with all of its utensils and consecrate the altar. The altar will be most holy.","17":"Now it happened during the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, the Tabernacle was raised up.","13":"Put the holy garments on Aaron, anoint him and consecrate him, so that he may minister to Me as a kohen.","27":"and he burned sweet spices of incense there, just as ADONAI had commanded Moses.","30":"Next he set up the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing,","18":"Moses raised the Tabernacle, and laid its bases, set up the framework of boards, put in the crossbars and set up its pillars.","36":"Now whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tabernacle, Bnei-Yisrael went onward, throughout all their journeys.","29":"Then he set the altar of burnt offering at the entrance of the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the grain offering, just as ADONAI had commanded Moses.","23":"He set a row of bread in order upon it before ADONAI, just as ADONAI had commanded Moses.","19":"Then he spread the tent over the Tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on it, just as ADONAI had commanded Moses.","1":"Then ADONAI spoke to Moses saying,","5":"Set the golden incense altar in front of the Ark of the Testimony, and hang the curtain over the entrance of the Tabernacle.","4":"Then bring in the table, and set in order the bread that is on it. Bring in the menorah and light its lamps.","8":"Set up the courtyard all around, and hang the curtain of the gate of the courtyard.","26":"Next he placed the golden altar in the Tent of Meeting before the curtain,","14":"Also bring his sons and put tunics upon them.","37":"But if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not move out until the day that it was.","22":"Then he set up the table inside the Tent of Meeting, on the side of the Tabernacle northward, outside the curtain.","28":"He hung the curtain over the entrance of the Tabernacle.","25":"Then he lit the lamps before ADONAI, just as ADONAI had commanded Moses.","9":"“Take the anointing oil and anoint the Tabernacle, and everything within it, and consecrate it, along with all of its furnishings, and it will be holy.","33":"He set up the courtyard around the Tabernacle and the altar and set up the screen at the gate of the courtyard. So Moses finished the work.","15":"You are to anoint them, as you did their father, so that they too may minister to Me as kohanim. Their anointing will be for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.”","34":"Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of ADONAI filled the Tabernacle.","21":"He brought the Ark into the Tabernacle, set up the curtain as a screen, and screened off the Ark of the Testimony, just as ADONAI had commanded Moses.","24":"Then he placed the menorah in the Tent of Meeting, over against the table, on the south side of the Tabernacle.","16":"Moses did so, just as ADONAI had commanded him.","35":"Moses was unable to enter into the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud resided there and the glory of ADONAI filled the Tabernacle.","32":"When they went into the Tent of Meeting and when they came near to the altar, they washed, just as ADONAI had commanded Moses.","7":"Set up the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it.","2":"“On the first day of the first month, you will set up the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting.","38":"For the cloud of ADONAI was on the Tabernacle by day and a fire was there by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all their journeys.","6":"“Set the altar of burnt offering before the entrance of the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting.","31":"so that Moses, Aaron and his sons could wash their hands and their feet there."},"13":{"16":"So it will be like a sign on your hand and like frontlets between your eyes, for by a strong hand ADONAI brought us out of Egypt.”","3":"Moses said to the people, “Remember this day, on which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage. For by a strong hand ADONAI brought you out from this place. No hametz may be eaten.","5":"When ADONAI brings you into the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you are to observe this service during this month.","21":"ADONAI went before them in a pillar of cloud by day to lead the way and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light. So they could travel both day and night.","18":"So God led the people around by the way of the wilderness to the Sea of Reeds, and Bnei-Yisrael went up out of the land of Egypt armed.","12":"you are to set apart to ADONAI every firstborn from the womb, and every firstborn male animal you have will be ADONAI’s.","10":"You are to keep this ordinance as a moed from year to year.","2":"“Consecrate to Me all the firstborn, from every womb of Bnei-Yisrael, both men and animals — this is Mine.”","22":"The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night never departed from the people.","8":"“You are to tell your son on that day saying, ‘It is because of what ADONAI did for me when I came out of Egypt.","17":"After Pharaoh had let the people go, God did not lead them along the road to the land of the Philistines, although that was nearby, for God said, “The people might change their minds if they see war and return to Egypt.”","11":"“Now when ADONAI brings you into the land of the Canaanite, as He swore to you and your fathers and gives it you,","1":"ADONAI spoke to Moses saying,","9":"So it will be like a sign on your hand and a reminder between your eyes, so that the Torah of ADONAI may be in your mouth. For with a strong hand ADONAI has brought you out of Egypt.","14":"“So when your son asks you in times to come, ‘What is this?’ say to him, ‘By a strong hand ADONAI brought us out from Egypt, the house of bondage,","7":"Matzot is to be eaten throughout the seven days, and no hametz is to be seen among you, nor within any of your borders.","15":"and when Pharaoh refused to let us go, ADONAI slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both men and animals. So I sacrifice to ADONAI all firstborn males, but I redeem the firstborn of my sons.’","20":"So they journeyed from Succoth and encamped in Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.","6":"For seven days you are to eat matzah, and the seventh day is to be a feast to ADONAI.","4":"This day, in the month of Aviv, you are going out.","19":"Moses also took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made Bnei-Yisrael swear an oath saying, “God will surely remember you, and then you are to carry my bones away with you.”","13":"Every firstborn donkey you are to redeem with a lamb, and if you do not redeem it, then you are to break its neck. But you are to redeem every firstborn male among your sons."},"27":{"16":"“For the gate of the courtyard there is to be a 20 cubit curtain of blue, purple, scarlet and finely twisted linen, the work of a color weaver, along with their four pillars and their four bases.","3":"You are to make pots for it to take away ashes, along with shovels, basins, forks and fire pans — make all the utensils of bronze.","5":"You are to place it under the ledge around the altar beneath, so that the net may reach halfway up the altar.","21":"In the Tent of Meeting, outside the curtain which is before the Testimony, Aaron and his sons will set it in order, to burn from evening to morning before ADONAI. It will be a statute forever throughout their generations, on behalf of Bnei-Yisrael.","18":"The length of the courtyard is to be 100 cubits, and the width 50 throughout.

In all their labors they worked them with cruelty.","7":"Yet Bnei-Yisrael were fruitful, increased abundantly, multiplied and grew extremely numerous — so the land was filled with them.","15":"Moreover the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah,","20":"So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied, growing very numerous.","6":"Then Joseph died, as did all his brothers and all that generation.","4":"Dan, Naphtali, Gad and Asher.","19":"The midwives told Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women. They are like animals,  and give birth before the midwife comes to them.”","13":"They worked them harshly,"},"5":{"16":"No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, ‘Make bricks!’ and look, your servants are beaten.

No straw will be given to you — but you must deliver the quota of bricks.”","12":"So the people were scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.","10":"Then the slave masters of the people went out, along with their officers, and they spoke to the people saying: “This is what Pharaoh says: I will not give you straw.","2":"But Pharaoh said, “Who is ADONAI, that I should listen to His voice and let Israel go? I do not know ADONAI, and besides, I will not let Israel go.”","22":"So Moses returned to ADONAI and said, “ADONAI, why have You brought evil on these people? Is this why You sent me?","8":"But impose on them the quota of bricks that they made previously; don’t reduce it. For they are lazy — that’s why they cry out saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’","17":"But he said, “Lazy! You’re lazy! That’s why you were saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to ADONAI.’","11":"Go and get straw for yourselves wherever you can find it, for there will be no reduction of your work.”","1":"Afterward, Moses and Aaron went and said to Pharaoh, “This is what ADONAI, God of Israel, says: Let My people go, so that they may hold a feast for Me in the wilderness.”","9":"Let even heavier work be laid upon the men, so that they must labor, paying no attention to deceptive words.”","14":"Moreover the foremen of Bnei-Yisrael, whom Pharaoh’s slave masters had set over them, were beaten and asked, “Why haven’t you met your quota of bricks, both yesterday and today like before?”","7":"“You are not to give the people any more straw to make bricks, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.","15":"The foremen of Bnei-Yisrael came and cried out to Pharaoh saying, “Why do you deal this way with your servants?","20":"Then they met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them as they came from Pharaoh.","23":"Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your Name, he has brought evil on these people. You have not delivered Your people at all.”","6":"Then on the same day Pharaoh commanded the slave masters of the people and their foremen saying,","4":"But the king of Egypt said to them, “Why do you, Moses and Aaron, make the people break loose from their work? Go to your labors!”","19":"So the foremen of Bnei-Yisrael saw that they were in trouble when they were told, “You are not to reduce the number of bricks from day to day.”","13":"But the slave masters pressured, saying, “Fulfill your work, your daily amount, just as when there was straw.”"},"4":{"11":"So ADONAI said to him, “Who made man’s mouth?

Moses took the staff of God in his hand.","12":"Now go! I will be with your mouth and teach you what to say.”","10":"But Moses said to ADONAI, “ADONAI, I am not a man of words — not yesterday, nor the day before, nor since You have spoken to Your servant — because I have a slow mouth and a heavy tongue.”","17":"Now then, you must take this staff in your hand to do the signs.”","13":"But he said, “Please, please, send it by another hand.”","27":"Now ADONAI said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he went and met him at the mountain of God, and kissed him.","30":"Aaron spoke all the words that ADONAI had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people.","18":"So Moses went, returned to his father-in-law Jethro and said to him, “Please let me go, so I may return to my kinsmen who are in Egypt and see whether they are still alive.” Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”","29":"Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of Bnei-Yisrael.","23":"So I have said to you, Let My son go, that he may serve Me, but you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will slay your son, your firstborn.’”","19":"Then ADONAI said to Moses in Midian, “Go, return to Egypt, for all the men that sought your life are dead.”","1":"Then Moses said, “But look, they will not believe me or listen to my voice. They will say, ‘ADONAI has not appeared to you.’”","5":"“This is so that they may believe ADONAI, the God of their fathers — the God of Abra-ham, Isaac and Jacob — has appeared to you.”","4":"Then ADONAI said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand, and take it by the tail.” So he put out his hand, laid hold of it, and it became a staff in his hand.","8":"Then He said, “If they do not believe you, or listen to the voice of the first sign, they will believe the message of the latter sign.","26":"She said, “A bridegroom of blood” because of the circumcision. Then He let him alone.","14":"Then the anger of ADONAI was kindled against Moses, so He said, “In fact, Aaron the Levite is your brother. I know that he can speak well. Moreover, he is on his way to meet you! When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.","22":"You are to say to Pharaoh, “This is what ADONAI says: ‘Israel is My son, My firstborn.","28":"Then Moses told Aaron all the words of ADONAI with which He had been sent, along with all the signs that He had commanded him to do.","25":"But Zipporah took a flint, cut off the foreskin of her son, and threw it at his feet, saying, “You are surely a bridegroom of blood to me.”","9":"But if they do not believe even these two signs nor listen to your voice, you are to take the water of the river and pour it on the dry land. The water which you take out of the river will become blood on the ground.”","15":"You are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth and with his, and teach you what to do.","21":"ADONAI said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you do all the wonders before Pharaoh that I have put in your hand. Still, I will harden his heart, and he will not let the people go.","24":"It happened along the way, at a lodging place, that ADONAI met him and sought to kill him!","16":"He will be your spokesman to the people, so that he may act as a mouthpiece for you, and it will be as if you were as God for him.","7":"Then He said, “Put your hand back into your cloak.” So he put his hand back in, and when he took it out it was restored again as the rest of his skin.","2":"So ADONAI said to him, “What is that in your hand?” “A staff,” he said.","6":"ADONAI also said to him, “Now put your hand within your cloak.” So he put his hand inside, and when he took it out, his hand had tza-ra’at — white as snow.","31":"So the people believed. When they heard that ADONAI had remembered Bnei-Yisrael and had seen their affliction, they bowed their heads and worshipped."},"8":{"11":"But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them — just as ADONAI had said.","3":"But the magicians did the same with their secret arts and brought up frogs over the land of Egypt.","20":"ADONAI did just so. A massive swarm of flies went into the house of Pharaoh and into his servant’s houses. All the land of Egypt was ruined because of the swarm of flies.","12":"So ADONAI said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, and it will become gnats  throughout all the land of Egypt.’”","10":"They piled them together in large heaps, and the land stank.","17":"Or else, if you do not let My people go, I will send the swarm of flies  on you and on your servants, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of the swarm of flies including the ground that they stand on.","13":"So they did. When Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, there were gnats on men and animals. All the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.","27":"ADONAI acted according to the word of Moses, and removed the swarm of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants and from his people. Nothing remained.","18":"“But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where My people are dwelling — except no swarm of flies will be there — so that you may know that I, ADONAI, am in the midst of the earth.","23":"We must walk a three-day journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to ADONAI our God — just as He tells us.”","19":"I will make a distinction between My people and your people. By tomorrow this sign will happen.”","1":"Then ADONAI told Moses, “Say to Aaron: Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, canals and pools, and cause frogs to come up over the land of Egypt.”","5":"Moses answered Pharaoh, “Boast about me after I pray for you. When am I to pray for you, your servants and your people, that the frogs would be cut off from you and your houses, and remain only in the Nile?”","4":"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to ADONAI, that He would take the frogs away from me and from my people. Then I will let the people go, so they may sacrifice to ADONAI.”","8":"After Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, Moses cried out to ADONAI concerning the frogs, which He had brought upon Pharaoh.","26":"Then Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to ADONAI.","14":"When the magicians attempted the same with their secret arts to bring forth gnats, they could not. There were gnats on men and animals.","22":"But Moses said, “That would not be right. For the offerings we intend to sacrifice to ADONAI our God are an abomination to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice what is an abomination to the Egyptians, wouldn’t they stone us?","28":"But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and did not let the people go.","25":"So Moses said, “See, I am leaving you, and I will pray to ADONAI that the swarm of flies will depart from Pharaoh, his servants and from his people tomorrow. However, let Pharaoh no longer deal deceitfully by not letting the people go sacrifice to ADONAI.”","9":"So ADONAI acted according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died out in the houses, the courts and the fields.","15":"So the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them — just as ADONAI had said.","21":"So Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron and said, “Go! Sacrifice to your God — in the land.”","24":"Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, so that you may sacrifice to ADONAI your God in the wilderness. Only you must not go very far away. Pray for me.”","16":"Then ADONAI said to Moses, “Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh. As he comes to the water say to him, This is what ADONAI says: Let My people go, that they may serve Me.","7":"The frogs will depart from you, from your houses, from your servants and from your people. They will remain only in the Nile.”","2":"So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land.","6":"“Tomorrow,” he said.
