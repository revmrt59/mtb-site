Has not one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously — a man against his brother — defiling the covenant of our fathers?","2":"If you will not listen, and if you will not take to heart to give glory to My Name” — says ADONAI-Tzva’ot — “then I will send the curse on you, and I will curse your blessings.

Then they will become for ADONAI those who present an offering in righteousness.","5":"“Then I will draw near to you in judgment, and I will be a swift witness against sorcerers, adulterers, perjurers those who extort a worker’s wage, or oppress the widow or an orphan, those who mislead a stranger.
