You will be filled with sorrow, but your sorrow will turn to joy!","12":"“I still have much more to tell you, but you cannot handle it just now.","10":"concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see Me;","17":"Then some of His disciples said to one another, “What does He mean by telling us, ‘A little while, and you will no longer see Me; and again in a little while, you will see Me’? And, ‘Because I am going to the Father’?”","13":"But when the Spirit of truth comes, He will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on His own; but whatever He hears, He will tell you. And He will declare to you the things that are to come.","27":"For the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from God.","30":"Now we know that You know everything and have no need to be asked anything. By this we believe that You came forth from God.”","18":"They kept on saying, “What’s this He’s saying, ‘A little while’? We don’t know what He’s talking about!”","29":"His disciples say, “See, now You’re speaking plainly and not in metaphors.","23":"“In that day, you will ask Me nothing. Amen, amen I tell you, whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give you.","19":"Yeshua knew that they wanted to question Him, so He said to them, “Are you asking each other about this, that I said, ‘A little while, and you will no longer see Me; and again in a little while, you will see Me’?","1":"“I have spoken these things to you so that you may be kept from stumbling.","5":"“But now I am going to the One who sent Me, and not one of you is asking Me, ‘Where are you going?’","4":"But I have spoken these things to you so that when their hour comes, you may remember that I told you of them. I did not tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.”","8":"“When He comes, He will convict the world about sin, righteousness, and judgment:","26":"In that day, you will ask in My name — and I’m not telling you that I will ask the Father on your behalf.","14":"He will glorify Me, because He will take from what is Mine and declare it to you.","22":"So also you have sorrow now; but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you!","28":"I came forth from the Father and have come into the world. Again I am leaving the world and going to the Father.”","25":"“These things I have spoken to you in metaphors. An hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in metaphors, but will tell you plainly about the Father.","9":"concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me;","33":"These things I have spoken to you, so that in Me you may have shalom. In the world you will have trouble, but take heart! I have overcome the world!”","15":"Everything that the Father has is Mine. For this reason I said the Ruach will take from what is Mine and declare it to you.”","21":"“When a woman is in labor, she has pain because her hour has come.  But when she gives birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, because of the joy that a human being has been born into the world.","24":"Up to now, you have not asked for anything in My name. Ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be full.","16":"“A little while, and you will no longer see Me; and again in a little while, you will see Me.”","32":"Look, the hour is coming — indeed has come — when you will be scattered, each to his own, and you will abandon Me. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.","7":"But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I go away! For if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.","2":"They will throw you out of the synagogues. Yes, an hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God.","6":"Because I have spoken these things to you, grief has filled your heart.","31":"Yeshua answered them, “Do you now believe?"},"3":{"11":"Amen, amen I tell you, We speak about what We know and testify about what We have seen. Yet you all do not receive Our testimony!","3":"Yeshua answered him, “Amen, amen I tell you, unless one is born from above,  he cannot see the kingdom of God.”","20":"For everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light, so that their deeds will not be exposed.","12":"If you do not believe the earthly things I told you, how will you believe when I tell you about heavenly things?","10":"Yeshua answered him, “You’re a teacher of Israel and you do not understand these things?","17":"God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through Him.","13":"No one has gone up into heaven except the One who came down from heaven — the Son of Man.","27":"John answered, “A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven.","30":"He must increase, while I must decrease.”","18":"The one who believes in Him is not condemned; but whoever does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not put his trust in the name of the one and only Ben-Elohim.","36":"He who trusts in the Son has eternal life. He who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.","29":"The one who has the bride is the bridegroom, but the best man rejoices when he stands and hears the bridegroom’s voice. So now my joy is complete!","23":"Now John also was immersing at Aenon near Salim, because much water was there and many were coming and being immersed;","19":"“Now this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world and men loved the darkness instead of the light,  because their deeds were evil.","1":"Now there was a man, a Pharisee named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jewish people.","5":"Yeshua answered, “Amen, amen I tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit,  he cannot enter the kingdom of God.","4":"“How can a man be born when he is old?” Nicodemus said to Him. “He cannot enter his mother’s womb a second time and be born, can he?”","8":"The wind blows where it wishes and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”","26":"They came to John and said, “Rabbi, the One who was with you beyond the Jordan, the One you testified about — look, He is immersing, and all are coming to Him!”","14":"Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert,  so the Son of Man must be lifted up,","22":"Afterwards, Yeshua and His disciples came to the land of Judea. There He was staying with them and immersing.","28":"You yourselves testify that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah,’ but rather, ‘I am sent before Him.’","25":"Now an argument came up between John’s disciples and a Judean concerning purification.","9":"“How can these things happen?” Nicodemus said.","33":"Whoever receives His testimony has certified that God is true.","15":"so that whoever believes in Him may have eternal life!","34":"The One whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Ruach without limit.","21":"But whoever practices the truth comes to the light, so that it may be made known that his deeds have been accomplished in God.”","24":"for John had not yet been thrown into prison.","16":"“For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.","35":"The Father loves the Son and has given everything into His hand.","32":"And what He has seen and heard, He testifies to that; yet no one receives His testimony.","7":"Do not be surprised that I said to you, ‘You all must be born from above.’","2":"He came to Yeshua at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that You, a teacher, have come from God. For no one can perform these signs which You do unless God is with Him!”","6":"What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.","31":"The One who comes from above is above all. The one who is from the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaks. The One who comes from heaven is above all."},"5":{"11":"But he answered them, “The man who made me well told me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’”","41":"“I do not accept glory from men.","45":"“Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father. The one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have put your hope.","42":"But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.","3":"In these a crowd of invalids was lying around — blind, lame, disabled.","20":"For the Father loves the Son and shows Him everything He does. He will show Him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed.","12":"They asked him, “Who is the man who told you, ‘Pick up your mat and walk’?”","10":"so Judean leaders were saying to the man who was healed, “It’s Shabbat! It’s not permitted for you to carry your mat.”","17":"But Yeshua said to them, “My Father is still working, and I also am working.”","44":"How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and you do not seek the glory that comes from God alone?","40":"Yet you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life!","13":"But the man who had been healed didn’t know who it was, for Yeshua had slipped away into the crowd in that place.","27":"Also He has given the Son authority to judge, because He is the Son of Man.","30":"I can do nothing on My own. Just as I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, for I do not seek My own will, but the will of the One who sent Me.”","18":"So for this reason the Judean leaders kept trying even harder to kill Him — because He was not only breaking Shabbat,  but also calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.","36":"“But the testimony I have is greater than that from John. The works the Father has given Me to finish — the very works I am doing — testify about Me, that the Father has sent Me.","29":"and come out!  Those who have done good will come to a resurrection of life, and those who have done evil will come to a resurrection of judgment.","23":"so that all should honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.","19":"Therefore Yeshua answered them, “Amen, amen I tell you, the Son cannot do anything by Himself. He can do only what He sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise.","1":"After this there was a Jewish feast, and Yeshua went up to Jerusalem.","47":"But since you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?”","5":"Now a certain man had been an invalid there for thirty-eight years.","4":"()","8":"Yeshua tells him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk!”","26":"For just as the Father has life in Himself, so also He has granted the Son to have life in Himself.","39":"You search the Scriptures because you suppose that in them you have eternal life. It is these that testify about Me.","14":"Afterwards, Yeshua finds him in the Temple. He said to him, “Look, you’ve been healed! Stop sinning, so nothing worse happens to you.”","37":"And the Father who sent Me has testified concerning Me. You have never heard His voice nor seen His form.","22":"The Father does not judge anyone, but has handed over all judgment to the Son","28":"“Do not be amazed at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear His voice","25":"Amen, amen I tell you, an hour is coming and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of Ben-Elohim. Those who hear will live!","9":"Immediately, the man was healed! He took up his mat and started walking around. Now that day was Shabbat,","33":"You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.","15":"The man left and told the Judean leaders that it was Yeshua who had made him well.","34":"I do not receive the testimony of man, but I say these things so that you may be saved.","21":"For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whomever He wants.","24":"“Amen, amen I tell you, whoever hears My word and trusts the One who sent Me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed over from death into life.","46":"For if you were believing Moses, you would believe Me — because he wrote about Me.","16":"Because Yeshua was doing these things on Shabbat, the Judean leaders started persecuting Him.","35":"He was the lamp that was burning and shining, and you wanted to rejoice for a while in his light.","32":"There is another who testifies about Me, and I know that the testimony He gives is true.","7":"The invalid answered Him, “Sir, I have nobody to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. While I’m trying to get in, somebody else steps down before me!”","43":"I have come in My Father’s name, and you do not receive Me. But if another comes in his own name, you will receive him.","2":"Now in Jerusalem there is a pool by the sheep gate, called Bethzatha in Aramaic,  which has five porches.","38":"Nor do you have His Word living in you, because you do not trust the One He sent.","6":"Seeing him lying there and knowing he had been that way a long time, Yeshua said to him, “Do you want to get well?”","31":"“If I testify about Myself, My witness is not valid."},"21":{"16":"He said to him again a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me?” “Yes, Lord,” he said, “You know that I love You.” He said to him, “Take care of My sheep!”","3":"Simon Peter said to them, “I’m going fishing.” “We’re coming with you too,” they said. They went out and got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing.","5":"So Yeshua said to them, “Boys, you don’t happen to have any fish, do you?” “No,” they answered Him.","21":"Seeing him, Peter said to Yeshua, “Lord, what about him?”","18":"“Amen, amen I tell you, when you were younger, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.”","12":"Yeshua said to them, “Come, have breakfast.” None of the disciples dared ask Him, “Who are You?” — knowing it was the Lord.","10":"Yeshua said to them, “Bring some of the fish you’ve just caught.”","2":"Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in the Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two of the other disciples were together.","22":"Yeshua said to him, “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me!”","8":"But the other disciples came in the boat from about two hundred cubits  offshore, dragging the net full of fish.","17":"He said to him a third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me?” Peter was grieved because He said to him for a third time, “Do you love Me?” And he said to Him, “Lord, You know everything! You know that I love You!” Yeshua said to him, “Feed My sheep!”","11":"Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net to shore. There were 153 fish, many of them big; but the net was not broken.","1":"After these things, Yeshua revealed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. Now here is how He appeared.","9":"So when they got out onto the land, they saw a charcoal fire with fish placed on it, and bread.","24":"This is the disciple who is an eyewitness of these things and wrote these things. We know that his testimony is true.","14":"This was now the third time that Yeshua was revealed to the disciples after He was raised from the dead.","7":"Therefore the disciple whom Yeshua loved said to Peter, “It’s the Lord!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he tied his outer garment around himself — for he was stripped down for work — and threw himself into the sea.","15":"When they had finished breakfast, Yeshua said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?” “Yes, Lord,” he said to Him, “You know that I love you.” He said to him, “Feed My lambs!”","20":"Peter, turning around, sees the disciple following. This was the one whom Yeshua loved, who also had reclined against Yeshua’s chest at the seder meal and said, “Master, who is the one who is betraying You?”","25":"There are also many other things that Yeshua did. If all of them were to be written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself will have room for the books being written!","23":"Therefore this saying went out among the brothers and sisters, that this disciple would not die. Yet Yeshua did not say to him that he would not die, but, “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?”","6":"He said to them, “Throw the net off the right side of the boat, and you’ll find some.” So they threw the net, and they were not able to haul it in because of the great number of fish.","4":"At dawn, Yeshua stood on the beach; but the disciples didn’t know that it was Yeshua.","19":"Now this He said to indicate by what kind of death Peter was going to glorify God. And after this, Yeshua said to him, “Follow Me!”","13":"Yeshua comes and takes the bread and gives it to them, and likewise the fish."},"18":{"11":"So Yeshua said to Peter, “Put the sword into the sheath! The cup the Father has given Me — shall I never drink it?”","3":"So Judah, having taken a band of soldiers and some officers from the ruling kohanim and Pharisees, comes there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.","20":"“I have spoken openly to the world,” Yeshua answered him. “I always taught in the synagogues and the Temple, where all the Jewish people come together. I spoke nothing in secret.","12":"Then the band of soldiers, with the captain and the officers of the Judeans, seized Yeshua and tied Him up.","10":"Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the kohen gadol, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant’s name was Malchus.","17":"The maidservant at the door says to Peter, “Aren’t you one of this Man’s disciples too?” He says, “No, I’m not.”","40":"They shouted back, “Not this One, but Bar-Abba!” Now Bar-Abba  was a revolutionary.","13":"They led Him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the kohen gadol that year.","27":"Again Peter denied it, and immediately a rooster crowed.","30":"They answered, “If He weren’t an evildoer, we wouldn’t have handed Him over to you.”","18":"The servants and officers were standing around a fire they had made, because it was cold and they were warming themselves. And Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself.","36":"Yeshua answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, then My servants would be fighting so that I wouldn’t be handed over to the Judean leaders. But as it is, My kingdom is not from here.”","29":"Therefore Pilate came out to them and said, “What charge do you bring against this man?”","23":"Yeshua answered him, “If I have spoken wrongly, give evidence of the wrong; but if rightly, why hit Me?”","19":"The kohen gadol then questioned Yeshua about His disciples and His teaching.","1":"When Yeshua had said these things, He went out with His disciples across the Kidron Valley,  where there was a garden, which He and His disciples entered.","5":"“Yeshua ha-Natzrati,” they answered Him. Yeshua tells them, “I am.” Now Judah, the one betraying Him, was also standing with them.","4":"Then Yeshua, knowing all the things coming upon Him, went forward. He said to them, “Who are you looking for?”","8":"Yeshua answered, “I told you, I am! If you’re looking for Me, let these men go their way.”","26":"One of the servants of the kohen gadol, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “Didn’t I see you in the garden with Him?”","39":"But it’s your custom that I release someone for you at Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”","14":"Now Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Judean leaders that it was better for one man to die on behalf of the people.","37":"So Pilate said to Him, “Are you a king, then?” Yeshua answered, “You say that I am a king. For this reason I was born, and for this reason I came into the world, so that I might testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.”","22":"When He had said this, one of the officers standing nearby gave Yeshua a slap, saying, “Is that the way you answer the kohen gadol?”","28":"Then they led Yeshua from Caiaphas to the Praetorium.  It was early. They themselves did not enter the Praetorium, so they would not become unclean but might eat the Passover.","25":"Now Simon Peter was standing outside and warming himself. So they said to him, “Aren’t you one of His disciples too?” He denied it and said, “No, I’m not!”","9":"This was so the word would be fulfilled that He spoke: “I did not lose one of those You have given Me.”","33":"So Pilate went back into the Praetorium, called for Yeshua, and asked Him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”","15":"Simon Peter was following Yeshua with another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the kohen gadol, so he went with Yeshua into the court of the kohen gadol.","34":"“Are you saying this on your own,” Yeshua answered, “or did others tell you about Me?”","21":"Why question Me? Ask those who have heard what I spoke to them. Look, they know what I said.”","24":"Then Annas sent Him, still tied up, to Caiaphas, the kohen gadol.","16":"But Peter was left standing outside by the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the kohen gadol, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in.","35":"Pilate answered, “I’m not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and ruling kohanim handed You over to me! What have You done?”","32":"This happened so that the word Yeshua spoke would be fulfilled, signifying what kind of death He was about to die.","7":"So again He asked them, “Who are you looking for?” And they said, “Yeshua ha-Natzrati.”","2":"Now Judah, who was betraying Him, also knew the place, because Yeshua had often met there with His disciples.","38":"Pilate said to Him, “What is truth?” After he said this, he went out again to the Judean leaders. He said to them, “I find no case against Him.","6":"So when Yeshua said to them, “I am,” they drew back and fell to the ground.","31":"Then Pilate said to them, “Take Him yourselves, and judge Him by your Torah!” The Judean leaders responded, “We are not authorized to put anyone to death.”"},"12":{"11":"because on account of him many of the Jewish people were going and putting their trust in Yeshua.","41":"Isaiah said these things because he saw His glory and spoke of Him.","45":"And whoever beholds Me beholds the One who sent Me.","42":"Nevertheless many, even among the leaders, put their trust in Him. But because of the Pharisees, they were not confessing Yeshua,  so they would not be thrown out of the synagogue;","3":"Then Miriam took a pound  of very expensive oil of pure nard and anointed Yeshua’s feet, and she wiped His feet dry with her hair. Now the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil.","20":"Now there were some Greeks among those who were going up to worship at the feast.","12":"The next day, the huge crowd that had come up for the feast heard that Yeshua was coming to Jerusalem.","10":"So the ruling kohanim made plans to kill Lazarus also,","17":"So the crowd, which had been with Yeshua when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, kept on telling everyone about it.","44":"Yeshua cried out, “Whoever puts trust in Me believes not in Me but in the One who sent Me!","40":"“He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so they might not see with their eyes nor understand with their hearts and turn back, and I would heal them.”","13":"So they took palm branches and went out to meet Him, shouting, “‘Hoshia-na! Baruch ha-ba b’shem ADONAI! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD!’  The King of Israel!”","27":"“Now My soul is troubled. And what shall I say? ‘Father, save Me from this hour’? But it was for this reason I came to this hour.","30":"Yeshua responded, “This voice hasn’t come for My sake, but for yours.","18":"It was also for this reason that the crowd came out to meet Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign.","36":"While you have the light, believe in the light so that you may become sons of light.” Yeshua spoke these things, then left and hid Himself from them.","29":"Therefore the crowd that was standing there and heard it was saying that it had thundered. Others were saying, “An angel has spoken to Him.”","23":"Yeshua answers them, saying, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified!","19":"So the Pharisees said to each other, “You see that you can’t do anything. Look, the whole world has taken off after Him!”","1":"Six days before Passover, Yeshua came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Yeshua had raised from the dead.","47":"“If anyone hears My words but doesn’t keep them, I do not judge him; for I came to save the world, not to judge the world.","5":"“Why wasn’t this oil sold for three hundred denarii  and the money given to the poor?”","49":"For I did not speak on My own, but the Father Himself who sent Me has commanded Me what to say and speak.","4":"But Judah from Kriot, one of His disciples, the one who was about to betray Him, said,","8":"You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have Me.”","26":"If any man serves Me, he must follow Me; and where I am, there also will My servant be. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.","39":"For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah also said,","14":"Finding a young donkey, Yeshua sat on it, as it is written,","37":"But even though He had performed so many signs before them, they weren’t trusting in Him.","22":"Philip comes and tells Andrew; Andrew and Philip come and tell Yeshua.","28":"Father, glorify Your name!” Then a voice came out of heaven, “I have glorified it, and again I will glorify it!”","25":"He who loves his life will lose it, and the one who hates his life in this world will keep it forever.","9":"Now a large crowd of Judeans knew He was there and came, not only for Yeshua but also to see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead.","33":"He said this to show the kind of death He was about to die.","15":"“Fear not, Daughter of Zion! Look! Your King is coming, sitting on a donkey’s colt.”","34":"The crowd answered Him, “We’ve heard from Scripture  that the Messiah remains forever. How can You say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’? Who is this Son of Man?”","21":"These came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in the Galilee. “Sir,” they said, “we want to see Yeshua.”","24":"Amen, amen I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls to the earth and dies, it remains alone. But if it dies, it produces much fruit.","46":"As light I have come into the world, so that everyone who trusts in Me should not remain in darkness.","16":"His disciples did not understand these things at first. But when Yeshua was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him and that the crowd had done these things for Him.","35":"Therefore Yeshua said to them, “The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness will not overtake you. The one who walks in darkness doesn’t know where he is going.","32":"And as I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all to Myself.”","7":"Therefore Yeshua said, “Leave her alone! She set it aside for the day of My burial.","43":"for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.","48":"The one who rejects Me and doesn’t receive My words has a judge; the word I spoke will judge him on the last day.","2":"So they prepared a dinner there for Yeshua. Martha was serving, and Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with Him.","38":"This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet, who said, “ADONAI, who has believed our report? To whom has the arm of ADONAI been revealed?”","50":"And I know that His commandment is life everlasting. Therefore what I say, I say just as the Father has told Me.”","6":"Now he said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief. Since he had the moneybox, he used to steal from what was put in it.","31":"Now is the judgment of this world! Now the prince of this world will be driven out!"},"10":{"11":"“I am the Good Shepherd.  The Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.","41":"Many people came to Him and were saying, “John performed no sign, but all John said about this man was true.”","42":"And many trusted in Him there.","3":"To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice. The shepherd calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.","20":"Many of them were saying, “He has a demon. He’s insane! Why listen to Him?”","12":"The hired worker is not the shepherd, and the sheep are not his own. He sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and flees. Then the wolf snatches and scatters the sheep.","10":"The thief comes only to steal, slaughter, and destroy. I have come that they might have life, and have it abundantly!","17":"“For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life, so that I may take it up again.","40":"Again He went back across the Jordan to the place where John first started immersing, and He stayed there.","13":"The man is only a hired hand and does not care about the sheep.","27":"My sheep hear My voice. I know them, and they follow Me.","30":"I and the Father are one.”","18":"No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down on My own. I have the authority to lay it down, and I have the authority to take it up again. This command I received from My Father.”","36":"do you say of Him, the One the Father set apart and sent into the world, ‘You speak blasphemy,’ because I said, ‘I am Ben-Elohim’?","29":"My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all. And no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.","23":"Yeshua was walking in the Temple around Solomon’s Colonnade.","19":"Again a division arose among the Judeans because of these words.","1":"“Amen, amen I tell you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber.","5":"They will never follow a stranger, but will run away from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.”","4":"“When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them; and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.","8":"All those who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.","26":"But you don’t believe, because you are not My sheep.","39":"Therefore they tried to capture Him again, but He escaped from their hand.","14":"“I am the Good Shepherd. I know My own and My own know Me,","37":"“If I don’t do the works of My Father, don’t believe Me!","22":"Then came Hanukkah;  it was winter in Jerusalem.","28":"I give them eternal life! They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of My hand.","25":"Yeshua answered them, “I told you, but you don’t believe! The works I do in My Father’s name testify concerning Me.","9":"I am the gate!  If anyone comes in through Me, he will be saved. He will come and go and find pasture.","33":"The Judean leaders answered, “We aren’t stoning you for a good work, but for blasphemy. Though You are a man, You make Yourself God!”","15":"just as the Father knows Me and I know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep.","34":"Yeshua answered them, “Isn’t it written in your Writings,  ‘I have said you are gods’?","21":"Others said, “These are not the sayings of someone who is plagued by a demon. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can it?”","24":"Then the Judean leaders surrounded Him, saying, “How long will You hold us in suspense? If You are the Messiah, tell us outright!”","16":"I have other sheep that are not from this fold; those also I must lead, and they will listen to My voice. So there shall be one flock, one Shepherd.","35":"If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the Word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),","32":"Yeshua answered them, “I’ve shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these are you going to stone Me?”","7":"So Yeshua said again, “Amen, amen I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.","2":"But he who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.","38":"But if I do, even if you don’t trust Me, trust the deeds. Then you may come to know and continue to understand that the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father.”","6":"Yeshua told them this parable, but they did not understand what He was telling them.","31":"Again the Judean leaders picked up stones to stone Him."},"2":{"16":"To those selling doves, He said, “Get these things out of here! Stop making My Father’s house a marketplace!”","3":"When the wine ran out, Yeshua’s mother said to Him, “They don’t have any wine!”","5":"His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever He tells you.”","21":"But He was talking about the temple of His body.","18":"The Judean leaders responded, “What sign do You show us, since You are doing these things?”","12":"After this Yeshua went down to Capernaum with His mother, brothers,  and disciples, and they stayed there a few days.","10":"and says to him, “Everyone brings out the good wine first, and whenever they are drunk, then the worse. But you’ve reserved the good wine until now!”","2":"and Yeshua and His disciples were also invited to the wedding.","22":"So after He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He was talking about this. Then they believed the Scripture and the word that Yeshua had spoken.","8":"Then He said to them, “Take some water out, and give it to the headwaiter.” And they brought it.","17":"His disciples remembered that it is written, “Zeal for your House will consume Me!”","11":"Yeshua did this, the first of the signs, in Cana of the Galilee — He revealed His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.","1":"On the third day, there was a wedding at Cana in the Galilee. Yeshua’s mother was there,","9":"Now the headwaiter did not know where it had come from, but the servants who had drawn the water knew. As the headwaiter tasted the water that had become wine, he calls the bridegroom","24":"But Yeshua did not entrust Himself to them, because He knew all men.","14":"In the Temple, He found the merchants selling oxen, sheep, and doves; also the moneychangers sitting there.","7":"Yeshua said to them, “Fill the jars with water!” So they filled them up to the top.","15":"Then He made a whip of cords and drove them all out of the Temple, both the sheep and oxen. He dumped out the coins of the moneychangers and overturned their tables.","20":"The Judean leaders then said to Him, “Forty-six years this Temple was being built, and You will raise it up in three days?”","25":"He did not need anyone to testify about man, for He knew what was in man.","23":"Now when He was in Jerusalem for the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, seeing the signs He was doing.","6":"Now there were six stone jars, used for the Jewish ritual of purification, each holding two to three measures.","4":"Yeshua said to her, “Woman, what does this have to do with you and Me? My hour hasn’t come yet.”","19":"“Destroy this Temple,” Yeshua answered them, “and in three days I will raise it up.”","13":"The Jewish feast of Passover was near, so Yeshua went up to Jerusalem."},"8":{"11":"“No one, Sir,” she said. “Then neither do I condemn you,” Yeshua said. “Go, and sin no more.”","41":"You are doing the deeds of your father.” They said to Him, “We were not born as illegitimate children — we have one Father, God Himself!”","45":"“But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me.","42":"Yeshua said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for from God I came and now I am here. For I have not come on My own, but He sent Me.","3":"The Torah scholars and Pharisees bring in a woman who had been caught in adultery. After putting her in the middle,","20":"He spoke these words in the treasury while teaching in the Temple, but no one arrested Him because His hour had not yet come.","56":"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day; he saw it and was thrilled.”","12":"Yeshua spoke to them again, saying, “I am the light of the world. The one who follows Me will no longer walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”","10":"Straightening up, Yeshua said to her, “Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?”","17":"Even in your Torah it is written that the testimony of two men is true.","51":"Amen, amen I tell you, if anyone keeps My word, he will never see death.”","44":"You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks lies he is just being himself — for he is a liar and the father of lies.","40":"But now you are seeking to kill Me — a Man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. This Abraham did not do!","13":"Then the Pharisees said to Him, “You are testifying about Yourself, so Your testimony is not valid.”","27":"They didn’t understand that He was talking to them about the Father.","30":"As He was speaking these things, many people put their trust in Him.","53":"You are not greater than our father Abraham who died, are You? The prophets also died! Who do You make Yourself out to be?”","18":"I am one witness for Myself, and the Father who sent Me bears witness for Me.”","36":"So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed!","29":"The One who sent Me is with Me. He has not left Me alone, because I always do what is pleasing to Him.”","23":"Yeshua said, “You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.","19":"Then they said to Him, “Where is your Father?” Yeshua answered, “You know neither Me nor My Father. If you knew Me, you would also know My Father.”","1":"But Yeshua went to the Mount of Olives.","47":"He who belongs to God hears the words of God. The reason you don’t hear  is because you do not belong to God.”","59":"Then they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Yeshua hid Himself and went out from the Temple.","5":"In the Torah, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do You say?”","54":"Yeshua answered, “If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing. It is My Father who gives Me glory — the One of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’","52":"“Now we know You have a demon!” the Judean leaders said to Him. “Abraham and the prophets died. Yet You say, ‘If anyone keeps My word, he will never taste death.’","49":"Yeshua answered, “I do not have a demon! I honor My Father, yet you dishonor Me.","4":"they say to Yeshua, “Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of committing adultery.","8":"Then He knelt down again and continued writing on the ground.","58":"Yeshua answered, “Amen, amen I tell you, before Abraham was, I am!”","26":"I have much to say and judge about you. But the One who sent Me is true, and I tell the world what I heard from Him.”","39":"“Abraham is our father,” they replied to Him. Yeshua said to them, “If you are Abraham’s children, do the deeds of Abraham.","14":"Yeshua answered them, “Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is valid. For I know where I came from and where I am going. But you don’t know where I come from or where I am going.","37":"I know you are Abraham’s children; yet you are trying to kill Me, because My word has no place in you.","22":"“He won’t kill Himself, will He?” the Judeans asked. “Is that why He says, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?”","28":"So Yeshua said, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know who I am. I do nothing by Myself, but speak just what the Father has taught Me.","25":"So they asked Him, “Who are you?” Yeshua replied, “What have I been telling you from the beginning?","9":"Now when they heard, they began to leave, one by one, the oldest ones first, until Yeshua was left alone with the woman in the middle.","33":"They answered Him, “We are Abraham’s children and have never been slaves to anyone! How can you say, ‘You will become free’?”","15":"You judge according to the flesh, but I do not judge anyone.","34":"Yeshua answered them, “Amen, amen I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.","21":"Then again Yeshua spoke to them, “I am going away. You will look for Me and die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.”","57":"Then the Judeans said to Him, “You’re not even fifty years old and you’ve seen Abraham?”","24":"Therefore I told you that you will die in your sins. If you don’t believe that I am, you will die in your sins.”","46":"Which one of you convicts Me of sinning? If I am telling the truth, why don’t you believe Me?","16":"Yet even if I do judge, My judgment is true, because it is not I alone but I with the Father who sent Me.","35":"Now the slave does not remain in the household forever; the son abides forever.","32":"You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free!”","7":"When they kept asking Him, He stood up and said, “The sinless one among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.”","43":"Why don’t you understand My speech? Because you’re not able to hear My word!","48":"The Judean leaders responded, “Aren’t we right to say you are a Samaritan and have a demon?”","2":"At dawn, He came again into the Temple. All the people were coming to Him, and He sat down and began to teach them.","38":"I tell of what I have seen with the Father; so also you do what you heard from the Father.”","55":"Yet you do not know Him, but I know Him. If I say I do not know Him, I will be a liar like you. Yet I do know Him and keep His Word.","50":"But I do not seek My own glory; there is One who is seeking and judging.","6":"Now they were saying this to trap Him, so that they would have grounds to accuse Him. But Yeshua knelt down and started writing in the dirt with His finger.","31":"Then Yeshua said to the Judeans who had trusted Him, “If you abide in My word, then you are truly My disciples."},"17":{"16":"They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.","3":"And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Yeshua the Messiah, the One You sent.","5":"Now, Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world came to be.”","21":"that they all may be one. Just as You, Father, are in Me and I am in You, so also may they be one in Us, so the world may believe that You sent Me.","18":"Just as You sent Me into the world, so I have sent them into the world.","12":"While I was with them, I was keeping them in Your name that You have given Me. I guarded them, and not one of them was lost except the son of destruction,  so that the Scripture would be fulfilled.","10":"All Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine; and I have been glorified in them.","2":"Even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, so may He give eternal life to all those You have given Him.","22":"The glory that You have given to Me I have given to them, that they may be one just as We are one —","8":"The words, which You gave Me, I have given to them.

Your word is truth.","11":"I am no longer in the world; but they are in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name that You have given Me, so that they may be one just as We are.","1":"Yeshua spoke these things; then, lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, “Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son, so the Son may glorify You.","9":"I ask on their behalf. Not on behalf of the world do I ask, but on behalf of those You have given Me, for they are Yours.","24":"“Father, I also want those You have given Me to be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory — the glory You gave Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.","14":"I have given them Your word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world just as I am not of the world.","7":"Now they have come to know that everything You have given Me is from You.","15":"I am not asking that You take them out of the world, but that You keep them from the evil one.","20":"“I pray not on behalf of these only, but also for those who believe in Me through their message,","25":"Righteous Father, the world did not know You, but I knew You; and these knew that You sent Me.","23":"I in them and You in Me — that they may be perfected in unity, so that the world may know that You sent Me and loved them as You loved Me.","6":"“I have made Your name known to the men of this world that You gave Me.

I say these words while I am still in the world, so that they may have My joy made full in themselves.","26":"I made your Name known to them, and will continue to make it known, so that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them.”"},"11":{"11":"After He said this, He tells them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I’m going there to wake him up.”","41":"So they rolled away the stone. Yeshua lifted up His eyes and said, “Father, I thank you that you have heard Me.","45":"Therefore many of the Judeans, who had come to Miriam and had seen what Yeshua had done, put their trust in Him.","42":"I knew that You always hear Me; but because of this crowd standing around I said it, so that they may believe that You sent Me.”","3":"So the sisters sent a word to Yeshua, saying, “Master, the one you love is sick!”","20":"When Martha heard that Yeshua was coming, she went out to meet Him; but Miriam sat in the house.","56":"So they were searching for Yeshua, saying to one another as they stood in the Temple, “What do you think? Won’t He come to the feast at all?”","12":"So the disciples said to Him, “Master, if he has fallen asleep, he will get better.”","10":"But if a man should walk around at night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.”","17":"So when Yeshua arrived, He discovered that Lazarus had been in the tomb already for four days.","51":"Now he did not say this by himself; but as the kohen gadol that year, he prophesied that Yeshua would die for the nation.","44":"He who had been dead came out, wrapped in burial clothes binding his hands and feet, with a cloth over his face. And Yeshua tells them, “Cut him loose, and let him go!”","40":"Yeshua says to her, “Didn’t I tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?”","13":"Now Yeshua had spoken about his death, but they thought He was talking about ordinary sleep.","27":"She says to Him, “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Messiah, Ben-Elohim who has come into the world.”","30":"Now Yeshua had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met Him.","53":"So from that day on, they plotted to kill Him.","18":"Bethany was less than two miles  from Jerusalem,","36":"So the Judeans said, “See how He loved him!”","29":"As soon as Miriam heard, she quickly got up and was coming to Him.","23":"Yeshua said to her, “Your brother will rise again.”","19":"and many of the Judeans had come to Martha and Miriam to console them about their brother.","1":"Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Miriam and her sister Martha.","47":"So the ruling kohanim and Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. “What are we doing?” they asked. “This Man is performing many signs!","5":"Now Yeshua loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.","54":"Therefore Yeshua no longer walked openly among the Judeans, but went from there to the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with His disciples.","52":"And not for the nation only, but also so that He might gather together into one the scattered children of God.","49":"But one of them, Caiaphas, who was kohen gadol that year, said to them, “You know nothing!","4":"When Yeshua heard this, He said, “This sickness will not end in death. It is for God’s glory, so that Ben-Elohim may be glorified through it.”","8":"“Rabbi,” the disciples say to Him, “just now the Judean leaders were trying to stone You! And You’re going back there again?”","26":"And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?”","39":"Yeshua says, “Roll away the stone!” Martha, the dead man’s sister, said to Him, “Master, by this time he stinks! He’s been dead for four days!”","14":"Then Yeshua told them clearly, “Lazarus is dead!","37":"But some of them said, “Couldn’t this One, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have also kept this man from dying?”","22":"But I know, even now, that whatever You may ask of God, He will give You.”","28":"After she said this, she left and secretly told her sister Miriam, “The Teacher is here, and He’s calling for you.”","25":"Yeshua said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life! Whoever believes in Me, even if he dies, shall live.","9":"Yeshua answered, “Aren’t there twelve hours in the day? If a man walks in the day, he doesn’t stumble, because he sees the light of the world.","33":"When Yeshua saw her weeping, and the Judeans who came with her weeping, He was deeply troubled in spirit and Himself agitated.","15":"I’m glad for your sake I wasn’t there, so that you may believe. Anyway, let’s go to him!”","34":"“Where have you laid him?” He asked. “Come and see, Master,” they tell Him.","21":"Martha said to Yeshua, “Master, if You had been here, my brother wouldn’t have died!","57":"Now the ruling kohanim and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was, he should report it so that they might arrest Him.","24":"Martha said to Him, “I know, he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.”","46":"But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Yeshua had done.","16":"Then Thomas called the Twin  said to the other disciples, “Let’s go too, so that we may die with Him!”","35":"Yeshua wept.","32":"So when Miriam came to where Yeshua was, she saw Him and fell at His feet, saying to Him, “Master, if You had been here, my brother would not have died!”","7":"Then after this, He said to His disciples, “Let’s go up to Judea again.”","43":"And when He had said this, He cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”","48":"If we let Him go on like this, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our holy place and our nation.”","2":"This was the same Miriam who anointed the Master with perfume and wiped His feet with her hair. It was her brother Lazarus who was sick.","38":"So Yeshua, again deeply troubled within Himself, comes to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.","55":"Now the Jewish Passover was near; and many people went up out of the regions to Jerusalem before Passover, to purify themselves.","50":"You don’t take into account that it is better for you that one man die for the people rather than for the whole nation to be destroyed.”","6":"However, when He heard that Lazarus was sick, He stayed where He was for two more days.","31":"The Judeans, who were with Miriam in the house and comforting her, seeing how quickly she got up and went out, followed her. They thought she was going to the tomb to weep there."},"1":{"11":"He came to His own, but His own did not receive Him.","41":"First he finds his own brother Simon and tells him, “We’ve found the Messiah!” (which is translated Anointed One).","45":"Philip finds Nathanael and tells him, “We’ve found the One that Moses in the Torah, and also the prophets, wrote about — Yeshua of Natzeret, the son of Joseph!”","42":"Andrew brought Simon to Yeshua. Yeshua looked at him and said, “You are Simon, son of John. You shall be called Kefa (which is translated Peter).”","3":"All things were made through Him, and apart from Him nothing was made that has come into being.","20":"He openly admitted and did not deny; he admitted, “I am not the Messiah.”","12":"But whoever did receive Him, those trusting in His name, to these He gave the right to become children of God.","10":"He was in the world, and the world was made through Him; but the world did not know Him.","17":"Torah was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Yeshua the Messiah.","51":"And He said, “Amen, amen I tell you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God going up and coming down on the Son of Man!”","44":"Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.","40":"Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard John speak and followed Yeshua.","13":"They were born not of a bloodline, nor of human desire, nor of man’s will, but of God.","27":"coming after me, whose sandals I’m not worthy to untie.”","30":"This is the One about whom I told you, ‘He who comes after me is above me, because He was before me.’","18":"No one has ever seen God; but the one and only God,  in the Father’s embrace, has made Him known.","36":"and watched Yeshua walking by. He said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”","29":"The next day, John sees Yeshua coming to him and says, “Behold, the Lamb  of God who takes away the sin of the world!","23":"He said, “I am ‘the voice of one crying in the wilderness, “Make straight the way of ADONAI,”’  as the prophet Isaiah said.”","19":"This is John’s testimony, when the Judean leaders sent kohanim and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”","1":"In the beginning was the Word.  The Word was with God, and the Word was God.","47":"Yeshua saw Nathanael coming toward Him. He said, “Look, a true Israelite! There’s nothing false in him.”","5":"The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overpowered it.","49":"“Rabbi,” Nathanael answered, “You are Ben-Elohim! You are the King of Israel!”","4":"In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.","8":"He was not the light, but he came to bear witness concerning the light.","26":"“I immerse in water,” John answered. “Among you stands One you do not know,","39":"“Come and see,” Yeshua tells them. So they came and saw where He was staying, and they spent that day with Him. It was about the tenth hour.","14":"And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. We looked upon His glory,  the glory of the one and only  from the Father, full of grace and truth.","37":"The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Yeshua.","22":"So they said to him, “Who are you? Give us an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”","28":"These things happened in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was immersing.","25":"They asked him, “If you’re not the Messiah, Elijah, or the Prophet, why then are you immersing?”","9":"The true light, coming into the world, gives light to every man.","33":"I did not know Him; but the One who sent me to immerse in water said to me, ‘The One on whom you see the Ruach coming down and remaining, this is the One who immerses in the Ruach ha-Kodesh.’","15":"John testifies about Him. He cried out, saying, “This is He of whom I said, ‘The One who comes after me is above me, because He existed before me.’”","34":"And I have seen and testified that this is Ben-Elohim.”","21":"“What then? Are you Elijah?” they asked him. “I am not,” said John. “Are you the Prophet?” “No,” he answered.","24":"Now those sent were from the Pharisees.","46":"“Natzeret!” Nathanael answered. “Can anything good come from there?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”","16":"Out of His fullness, we have all received grace on top of grace.","35":"Again the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples","32":"Then John testified, “I have seen the Ruach coming down like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on Him.","7":"He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that through him everyone might believe.","43":"The next day, Yeshua decided to go to the Galilee. He finds Philip and says to him, “Follow Me!”","48":"Nathanael said to Him, “How do you know me?” Yeshua answered, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”","2":"He was with God in the beginning.","38":"Yeshua turned around and saw them following. He said to them, “What are you looking for?” They said to Him, “Rabbi” (which is translated Teacher), “where are you staying?”","50":"“Because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree, you believe?” Yeshua replied to him. “You will see greater things than that!”","6":"There came a man sent from God, whose name was John.","31":"I didn’t know Him, but I came immersing with water so that He might be revealed to Israel.”"},"9":{"11":"He answered, “The Man who is called Yeshua made mud, rubbed it on my eyes, and said to me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ So I went away and washed, and then I received my sight!”","41":"Yeshua said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no sin. But now you say, ‘We see.’ So your sin remains.”","3":"Yeshua answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned.

You don’t want to become His disciples too, do you?”","30":"The man replied to them, “That’s amazing! You don’t know where He is from, yet He opened my eyes!","18":"So the Judean leaders didn’t believe that he had been blind and received his sight until they called his parents.","36":"The man answered, “Who is He, Sir? Tell me, so that I may believe in Him!”","29":"We know that God has spoken to Moses; but as for this fellow, we don’t know where He is from.”","23":"That’s why his parents said, “He’s old enough — ask him.”","19":"They questioned them, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? Then how does he see now?”","1":"As Yeshua was passing by, He saw a man who had been blind since birth.","5":"While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”","4":"We must do the work of the One who sent Me, so long as it is day! Night is coming when no one can work.","8":"Therefore his neighbors and those who had seen him as a beggar kept saying, “Isn’t this the one who used to sit and beg?”","26":"So they asked him, “What did He do to you?

Ask him — he’s old enough. He will speak for himself.”","24":"So a second time they called the man who had been blind and said, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner!”","16":"So some of the Pharisees began saying, “This man isn’t from God, because He doesn’t keep Shabbat!” But others were saying, “How can a sinner perform such signs?” So there was a split among them.","35":"Yeshua heard that they had thrown him out. Finding him, He said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”","32":"Since the beginning of the world, no one has ever heard that anyone has opened the eyes of a man born blind.","7":"He told him, “Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam” (which is translated Sent). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.","2":"His disciples asked Him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?”","38":"He said, “Lord, I believe!” And he worshiped Him.","6":"Having said these things, He spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, and spread the mud on the blind man’s eyes.","31":"We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners; but if anyone fears Him and does His will, He hears this one."},"14":{"11":"Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me — or at least believe because of the works themselves.","3":"If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and take you to Myself, so that where I am you may also be.","20":"“In that day, you will know that I am in My Father, you are in Me, and I am in you.","12":"“Amen, amen I tell you, he who puts his trust in Me, the works that I do he will do; and greater than these he will do, because I am going to the Father.","10":"Don’t you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?

When He comes, He will explain everything to us.”","9":"Then the Samaritan woman tells Him, “How is it that You, a Jew, ask me, a Samaritan woman, for a drink?” (For Jewish people don’t deal with Samaritans.)","33":"So the disciples were saying to each other, “No one brought Him food to eat, did they?”","15":"“Sir,” the woman tells Him, “give me this water, so I won’t get thirsty or have to come all the way here to draw water!”","34":"Yeshua tells them, “My food is to do the will of the One who sent Me and to accomplish His work.","21":"Yeshua tells her, “Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.","24":"God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”","46":"So He went again to Cana of the Galilee, where He had turned the water into wine. Now there was a nobleman whose son was sick in Capernaum.","16":"He tells her, “Go call your husband, and then come back here.”","35":"Don’t you say, ‘Four more months, and then comes the harvest’? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields! They are white and ready for harvest.","32":"But He said to them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”","7":"A Samaritan woman comes to draw water. “Give me a drink,” Yeshua tells her,","43":"After the two days, He went on from there into the Galilee.","48":"Then Yeshua said to him, “Unless you all see signs and wonders, you’ll never believe!”","2":"(Although Yeshua Himself was not immersing, His disciples were.)","38":"I sent you to reap what you haven’t worked for. Others have worked hard, and you have joined in their work.”","50":"Yeshua tells him, “Go! Your son lives!” The man believed the word that Yeshua said to him and started off.","6":"Now Jacob’s well was there. So Yeshua, exhausted from the journey, was sitting by the well. It was midday.","31":"Meanwhile, the disciples were pressing Him, “Rabbi, eat!”"},"19":{"11":"Yeshua answered, “You would have no authority over Me if it hadn’t been given to you from above. For this reason, the one who handed Me over to you has the greater sin.”","41":"Now in the place where He was executed, there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb  where no one had yet been buried.","42":"Because it was the Jewish Day of Preparation and the tomb was nearby, they laid Yeshua there.","3":"They kept coming up to Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and slapping Him over and over.","20":"Many Judeans read this sign, because the place where Yeshua was executed was near the city; it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.","12":"Pilate tried to let Him go after this; but the Judean leaders cried out, saying, “If you release this Man, you are no friend of Caesar. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar!”","10":"So Pilate said to Him, “You aren’t speaking to me? Don’t You know that I have the authority to release You, and I have the authority to crucify You?”","17":"Then they took Yeshua. He went out, carrying His own crossbar, to the Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic  is called Golgotha.","40":"Then they took the body of Yeshua and wrapped it in linen with the spices, as is the Jewish burial custom.","13":"So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Yeshua out and sat down on the judge’s seat at a place called the Stone Pavement (but in Aramaic,  Gabbatha).","27":"Then He tells the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” From that very hour, the disciple took her into his own home.","30":"When Yeshua tasted the sour wine, He said, “It is finished!” And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.","18":"There they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on each side and Yeshua in between.","36":"These things happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, “Not a bone of His shall be broken.”","29":"A jar full of sour wine was sitting there, so they put a sponge soaked with the sour wine on a hyssop branch and brought it to His mouth.","23":"So the soldiers, when they executed Yeshua, took His outer garments and made four parts, a part for each soldier. They took His tunic also, but it was seamless, woven top to bottom in one piece.","19":"Pilate also wrote a sign and put it on the execution stake. It was written, “YESHUA HA-NATZRATI, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”","1":"Then Pilate took Yeshua and had Him scourged.","5":"So Yeshua came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. “Behold, the Man!” Pilate said to them.","4":"Pilate came out again. He said to them, “Look, I’m bringing Him out to you, to let you know that I find no case against Him.”","8":"When Pilate heard this word, he became even more fearful.","26":"Yeshua saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby. He tells His mother, “Woman, behold, your son!”","39":"Nicodemus, who had first visited Yeshua at night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.","14":"It was the Day of Preparation for Passover, about the sixth hour.  And Pilate said to the Judean leaders, “Behold, your king!”","37":"And again another Scripture says, “They shall look on Him whom they have pierced.”","22":"“What I have written, I have written,” Pilate answered.","28":"After this, when Yeshua knew that all things were now completed, to fulfill the Scripture He said, “I am thirsty.”","25":"Standing near the execution stake of Yeshua were His mother, His mother’s sister, Miriam the wife of Clopas, and Miriam from Magdala.","9":"He went into the Praetorium again and said to Yeshua, “Where are You from?” But Yeshua gave him no answer.","33":"Now when they came to Yeshua and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.","15":"They shouted back, “Take Him away! Take Him away! Execute Him!” Pilate said to them, “Should I execute your king?” The ruling kohanim answered, “We have no king but Caesar!”","34":"But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.","21":"The ruling kohanim of the Judeans were saying to Pilate, “Don’t write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that He said, ‘I am King of the Jews.’”","24":"So they said to one another, “Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be.” This was so the Scripture would be fulfilled, “They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots.”  So the soldiers did these things.","16":"Finally, Pilate handed Yeshua over to be crucified.","35":"He who has seen it has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe.","32":"So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and then the other who had been executed with Yeshua.","7":"The Judean leaders answered him, “We have a law,  and according to the Torah He must die, because He claimed to be Ben-Elohim!”","2":"The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and dressed Him in a purple robe.","38":"After these things, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate if he could take Yeshua’s body away. Joseph was a disciple of Yeshua, but secretly for fear of the Judean leaders. Pilate gave permission, so Joseph came and took the body away.","6":"When the ruling kohanim and officers saw Him, they yelled out, “Execute Him! Execute Him!”  Pilate said to them, “Take Him yourselves and execute Him! For I don’t find a case against Him.”","31":"It was the Day of Preparation, and the next day was a festival Shabbat. So that the bodies should not remain on the execution stake during Shabbat, the Judean leaders asked Pilate to have the legs broken and to have the bodies taken away."},"13":{"11":"He knew who was betraying Him; for this reason, He said, “Not all of you are clean.”","3":"Yeshua knew that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was returning to God.","20":"Amen, amen I tell you, he who receives the one I send, receives Me; and he who receives Me, receives the One who sent Me.”","12":"So after He had washed their feet and put His robe back on and reclined again, He said to them, “Do you understand what I have done for you?","10":"Yeshua said to him, “He who has bathed has no need to wash, except the feet; he is completely clean. And you all are clean, though not every one.”","17":"If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them!”","13":"You call Me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Master’ — and rightly you say, for I am.","27":"And with that bit, satan entered into him. Then Yeshua tells him, “What you’re about to do, do quickly!”","30":"So after Judah received the bit of matzah, he left immediately. Now it was night.","18":"“I am not speaking to all of you — I know whom I have chosen. But so the Scripture may be fulfilled, ‘He who eats My bread has lifted up his heel against Me.’","36":"“Master, where are You going?” Simon Peter said to Him. Yeshua answered, “Where I am going, you cannot follow Me now; but you will follow Me later.”","29":"Since Judah had the moneybox, some thought Yeshua was telling him, “Buy what we need for the feast,” or that he should give something to the poor.","23":"One of His disciples, whom Yeshua loved, was reclining at His side.","19":"From now on I am telling you, before it happens, so that when it happens you may believe that I am.","1":"Now it was just before the feast of Passover. Yeshua knew that His hour had come to depart from this world to the Father. Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them until the end.","5":"Then He pours water into a basin. He began to wash the disciples’ feet, drying them with the towel wrapped around Him.","4":"So He gets up from the meal and lays aside His outer garment; and taking a towel, He wrapped it around His waist.","8":"Peter said to Him, “You shall never wash my feet!” Yeshua answered him, “If I don’t wash you, you have no part with Me.”","26":"Yeshua answers, “It’s the one I will give this bit of matzah to, after I dip it.” After dipping the matzah,  He takes it and gives it to Judah from Kriot, the son of Simon.","14":"So if I, your Master and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash each other’s feet.","37":"Peter said to Him, “Master, why can’t I follow You now? I’ll lay down my life for You!”","22":"The disciples began looking at each other, perplexed — who was He talking about?","28":"But no one reclining at the table knew why Yeshua said this to him.","25":"Then he who leaned on Yeshua’s chest says to Him, “Master, who is it?”","9":"Simon Peter said to Him, “Master, then not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!”","33":"Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will search for Me; and just as I told the Judean leaders, so I say to you now, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come.’","15":"I have given you an example — you should do for each other what I have done for you.","34":"“I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, so also you must love one another.","21":"After He said these things, Yeshua was agitated in spirit and testified, “Amen, amen I tell you, one of you will betray Me!”","24":"Simon Peter nods to him and says, “Ask Him — who is He talking about?”","16":"“Amen, amen I tell you, a servant isn’t greater than his master, and the one who is sent isn’t greater than the one who sent him.","35":"By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.”","32":"If God is glorified in Him,  God will glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him at once.","7":"Yeshua responded, “You don’t know what I am doing now, but you will understand after these things.”","2":"While the seder meal was happening, the devil had already put in the heart of Judah from Kriot that he should hand over Yeshua.","38":"Yeshua answers, “Will you lay down your life for Me? Amen, amen I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times!”","6":"Then He comes to Simon Peter, who says to Him, “Master, are You going to wash my feet?”","31":"Then when Judah had gone out, Yeshua said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him!"}}}
