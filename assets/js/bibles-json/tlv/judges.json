Then he put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is near Hebron.","20":"Then she said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” When he awoke from his sleep, he thought, “I’ll go out as at other times, and shake myself off.” He did not comprehend that ADONAI had departed from him.","12":"So Delilah took new ropes, tied him up with them and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” Yet while the ambush was waiting in the inner room, he snapped them from his arms like a thread.","10":"Delilah said to Samson, “Oh, you deceived me! You lied to me! Now tell me please, how you can be bound?”","17":"So he divulged to her all his heart and said to her, “No razor has ever been upon my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will go from me, and I will be weak and be like any other man.”","13":"So Delilah said to Samson, “Up to now you’ve mocked me and told me lies! Tell me how you can be bound!” He told her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web of a loom.”","27":"Now the temple was full of men and women. All the Philistine lords were there and about 3,000 men and women on the roof looking on while Samson was amusing them.","30":"Then Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” He bent with all his might so that the temple fell on the lords and on all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he killed during his life.","18":"Now when Delilah realized that he had confided to her all his heart, she sent and called for the Philistine lords saying, “Come up this time, for he has told me all his heart.” So the Philistine lords came up to her and brought the silver in their hand.","29":"Then Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the temple rested and leaned on them, one with his right hand and the other with his left.","23":"Now the Philistine lords gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, as they said, “Our god has given our enemy Samson into our hand.”","19":"Then she made him sleep upon her knees, and she called for a man and had the seven locks of his head shaved off. She even began to humiliate him while his strength departed from him.","1":"Once Samson went to Gaza and eyed a prostitute there, so he went to her.","5":"So the Philistine lords came up to her and said to her, “Coax him, see where his great strength comes from and by what we may overpower him, so we may bind him to subdue him — then we’ll each of us give you 1,100 pieces of silver.”","4":"It came about afterward that he fell in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.","8":"So the Philistine lords brought up to her seven fresh cords that had never been dried, and she bound him with them,","26":"Then Samson said to the lad that held him by the hand, “Let me feel the pillars on which the temple rests, so I may lean on them.”","14":"So she pinned it with a pin and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he awoke from his sleep and pulled away the pin of the loom and the web.","22":"However, the hair of his head began to grow again after it was shaved off.","28":"Then Samson called out to ADONAI and said, “My Lord ADONAI, please remember me and please strengthen me only this once, O God, so that I may this once take revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes.”","25":"Now it came about when their hearts were merry that they said, “Call for Samson, that he may amuse us.” So they called for Samson from the prison, and he did make them laugh, when they made him stand between the pillars.","9":"while an ambush was waiting in an inner room. “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” she said to him. But he broke the cords just as a strand of straw snaps when it touches fire. So his strength remained unknown.","15":"“How can you say, ‘I love you,’” she said to him, “when your heart is not with me? This is three times you’ve deceived me and not told me where your great strength comes from.”","21":"Then the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes. They brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze chains, and he became a grinder in the prison.","24":"When the people saw him, they praised their god, as they said, “Our god has given into our hand our enemy and the destroyer of our country, who has slain many of us.”","16":"Now it came about when she nagged him daily with her speeches and kept bothering him, his soul was annoyed to death.","7":"Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven fresh cords that have never been dried, then I would be weak and be like any other man.”","2":"The Gazites were told, “Samson has come here.” So they surrounded him, lay in ambush for him all night at the gate of the city, and kept quiet all night saying, “When morning light comes, then we kill him.”","6":"So Delilah said to Samson, “Tell me please, where does your great strength come from? How could you be bound to subdue you?”","31":"Then his kinsmen and all his father’s household came down, lifted him, brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. For he had judged Israel 20 years."},"3":{"11":"Then the land had peace 40 years. When Othniel son of Kenaz died,","3":"These nations included the five Philistine lords, and all the Canaanites, Zidonians and the Hivites living in the hill country of Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath.","20":"Then Ehud approached him while he was sitting alone in a roof chamber where it was cool, and said, “I have a message from God for you,” so he arose from his throne.","12":"Bnei-Yisrael again did what was evil in ADONAI’s eyes. So ADONAI strengthened King Eglon of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in ADONAI’s eyes.","10":"The Spirit of ADONAI came upon him as he judged Israel. When he went out to war, ADONAI gave King Cushan-rishathaim of Aram into his hand so that he had the upper hand over Cushan-rishathaim.","17":"Then he presented the tribute to King Eglon of Moab. Eglon was a very fat man.","13":"So he gathered to himself the people of Ammon and Amalek, then went and defeated Israel and took possession of the City of Palms.","27":"When he arrived, he blew the shofar in the hill country of Ephraim, so Bnei-Yisrael went down with him from the hill country, and he was in front of them.","30":"So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. Then the land had peace for 80 years.","18":"Now when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he dismissed the people who had carried the tribute,","29":"Then they struck down at that time about 10,000 men of Moab — all stout men of valor — not a man escaped.","23":"Then Ehud went out by the porch, shut the doors of the roof chamber on him, and locked them.","19":"but he himself turned back, at the idols that were near Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” “Keep silence!” he replied, so all his attendants left him.","1":"Now these are the nations that ADONAI left, to test all Israel who had not experienced any of the wars of Canaan.","5":"But Bnei-Yisrael settled among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites,","4":"They were for testing Israel, to know whether they would obey the mitzvot of ADONAI, which He had commanded their fathers by Moses’ hand.","8":"So ADONAI’s anger burned against Israel, and He sold them over into the hand of King Cushan-rishathaim of Aram-naharaim, and Bnei-Yisrael served Cushan-rishathaim for eight years.","26":"But Ehud escaped while they were lingering, passed beyond the idols and escaped to Seirah.","14":"Bnei-Yisrael became subject to King Eglon of Moab for 18 years.","22":"Even the handle went in after the blade and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not withdraw the sword out of his belly — and the filth came out.","28":"He said to them, “Follow me, for ADONAI has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan opposite Moab, and allowed no one to cross over.","25":"So they waited till they were embarrassed, but behold, he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber. So they took the key and opened them — and behold, their master was lying dead on the floor.","9":"When Bnei-Yisrael cried out to ADONAI, ADONAI raised up a deliverer for Bnei-Yisrael to deliver them — Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger kinsman.","15":"But when Bnei-Yisrael cried out to ADONAI, ADONAI raised up a deliverer for them, Ehud son of Gera the Benjamite — a left-handed man. Now Bnei-Yisrael sent tribute with him to King Eglon of Moab.","21":"Then Ehud reached with his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh and thrust it into his belly.","24":"After he had gone out, his courtiers came and looked, but behold, the doors of the roof chamber were locked. So they said, “He is only relieving himself in the cool chamber.”","16":"Ehud made himself a double-edged sword, a cubit in length, which he girded on his right thigh under his cloak.","7":"Bnei-Yisrael did what was evil in ADONAI’s eyes, forgot ADONAI their God and worshipped the Baalim and the Asherahs.","2":"It was only in order that the generations of Bnei-Yisrael might learn from war, which they had not experienced before.","6":"and took their daughters for themselves as wives, gave their own daughters to their sons, and worshipped their gods.","31":"After him came Shamgar son of Anath, who struck down 600 Philistine men with an ox-goad. So he also delivered Israel."},"5":{"11":"Louder than the sound of archers, at the watering places! There let them rehearse the righteous acts of ADONAI, the righteous deeds for His villages in Israel. Then the people of ADONAI went down to the gates.","3":"Listen, O kings! Give ear, O rulers! I, to ADONAI I will sing, I will sing praise to ADONAI, the God of Israel.","20":"From heaven, the stars fought, in their courses they fought Sisera.","12":"Awake, awake, Deborah! Awake, awake, utter a song! Arise, Barak, lead away your captives, O son of Abinoam!","10":"Riders on white donkeys, sitting on saddle blankets, traveling on the road, sing!","17":"Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan, and Dan, why did he stay by the ships? Asher sat at the seacoast, dwelling by its docks.","13":"Then a remnant of nobles came down. ADONAI’s people came down to me with the mighty ones.","27":"At her feet he collapsed, he fell, he lay. Between her feet he bowed, he fell. Where he bowed, there he fell dead.","30":"‘Are they not finding, dividing the spoil? A maiden, maidens for every warrior! To Sisera a spoil of dyed garments — a spoil of dyed garments of embroidery, double-dyed garments of embroidery for the necks of every spoiler!’","18":"Zebulun is a people who jeopardized their lives to death, and Naphtali also, on the heights of the battlefield.","29":"The wisest of her princesses answer her, yes, she repeats the words to herself:","23":"‘Curse Meroz!’ said the angel of ADONAI, ‘Utterly curse its inhabitants, for they came not to the aid of ADONAI, to the aid of ADONAI among the mighty.’","19":"The kings came, they fought, then the kings of Canaan fought, at Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo, but they took no spoil of silver.","1":"Then Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang on that day saying:","5":"The mountains quaked before ADONAI, this Sinai at the presence of ADONAI, the God of Israel!","4":"ADONAI, when You came out from Seir, when You marched from Edom’s field, the earth trembled, the heavens also dropped, yes, the clouds dropped water.","8":"They chose new gods — then war was in the gates. No shield or spear was seen among 40,000 in Israel!","26":"Her hand reached for the tent pin, her right hand to the workmen’s hammer, and with the hammer she struck Sisera, she smashed his head — yes, she crushed and pierced his temple.","14":"Those with root in Amalek are from Ephraim, following you, Benjamin, with your peoples. From Machir came down rulers, and from Zebulun wielding the marshal’s staff.","22":"Then the horses’ hooves beat from the dashing, the dashing of his mighty steeds.","28":"Through the window, Sisera’s mother looked out, through the lattice. and lamented shrilly: ‘Why does his chariot delay in coming? Why do the wheels of his chariots tarry?’","25":"Water he asked, milk she gave him. In a lordly bowl she brought him butter.","9":"My heart is with Israel’s rulers, who offer themselves freely among the people. Bless ADONAI!","15":"Issachar’s chiefs were with Deborah. Issachar was with Barak. Into the valley they rushed at his heels. Among the divisions of Reuben there were great resolves of heart.","21":"The Kishon torrent swept them away — that ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon! O my soul, march on with strength!","24":"Blessed above women is Yael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, above women in the tent is she blessed.","16":"Why did you stay in the sheepfolds — to hear the piping for the flocks? Among the clans of Reuben there was much searching of heart.","7":"Villages were deserted in Israel, deserted, until I, Deborah, arose, a mother in Israel arose.","2":"“When leaders take the lead in Israel, when people freely offer themselves, bless ADONAI!","6":"In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Yael, the highways were deserted, travelers walked by crooked paths.","31":"So let all Your enemies perish, ADONAI! But may those who love Him be like the rising of the sun in its might.”  Then the land had peace for 40 years."},"21":{"16":"Then the elders of the congregation said, “What should we do about wives for those who are left, since the women have been destroyed out of Benjamin?”","3":"They said, “ADONAI God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that one tribe should be missing in Israel?”","5":"Then Bnei-Yisrael asked, “Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the assembly before ADONAI?” For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who did not come up to ADONAI at Mizpah saying, “He will surely be put to death.”","21":"and watch, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh should come out to join in the dances, then come out of the vineyards, and let each of you catch his wife from among the daughters of Shiloh. Then go to the land of Benjamin.","18":"Yet we cannot give them wives of our daughters,” for Bnei-Yisrael had sworn saying, “Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin!”","12":"So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead 400 young virgins who had not known man by lying with him. They brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.","10":"So the congregation sent 12,000 valiant warriors there, and commanded them saying, “Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.","2":"So the people came to Bethel and sat there till evening before God, and lifted up their voices and wept bitterly.","22":"So it will be, if their fathers or brothers come to complain to us, that we will say to them, ‘Grant them graciously for us, because we did not provide each one of them his wife in battle — nor did you give the girls to them, else you would now be guilty.’”","8":"Then they inquired, “Which one of the tribes of Israel that did not go up to ADONAI at Mizpah?” Then behold, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.","17":"They said “The survivors of Benjamin must have heirs, so that a tribe would not be blotted out from Israel.","11":"Now this is the thing that you will do: you are to utterly destroy every male and every woman who has lain with a man.”","1":"Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah saying, “None of us will give his daughter to Benjamin in marriage.”","9":"For when the people were numbered, behold not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there.","24":"So Bnei-Yisrael departed from there at that time, each man to his tribe and family. Everyone went out from there to his own inheritance.","14":"When Benjamin returned at that time, they gave them the women whom they had spared from the women of Jabesh-gilead. Yet they were not enough for them.","7":"What should we do about providing wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by ADONAI not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?”","15":"So the people were sorry for Benjamin because ADONAI had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.","20":"So they commanded the children of Benjamin saying, “Go and hide in the vineyards,","25":"In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.","23":"So the children of Benjamin did so, and took the number of wives from the dancers whom they carried off. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and rebuilt the towns and settled in them.","6":"Now Bnei-Yisrael felt sorry for Benjamin their brother and said, “Today one tribe has been cut off from Israel.","4":"Then it was on the next day that the people rose up early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.","19":"So they said, “Behold, there is the feast of ADONAI from year to year at Shiloh” (which is to the north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and to the south of Lebonah).","13":"Then the whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed shalom to them."},"18":{"11":"So from the Danite clan from Zorah and Eshtaol, 600 men set out, armed with weapons of war.","3":"When they were near the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young man, the Levite. So they turned aside there and asked him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What do you have here?”","20":"So the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, the household idols and the carved image, and went along among the people.","12":"They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. Therefore they called that place Mahaneh-Dan to this day — behold, it is west of Kiriath-jearim.","10":"When you get there, you will come to unsuspecting people. The land is spacious. For God has put it in your hand — a place where there is no lack of anything on the earth.”","17":"The five men who had gone to spy out the land went up and entered there. They took the carved image, the ephod, the household idols and the molten image, while the priest was standing by the entrance of the gate with the 600 men armed with weapons of war.","13":"From there they passed on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah’s house.","27":"Then they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and came to Laish, to a tranquil and unsuspecting people, and struck them with the edge of the sword, and they burned the town with fire.","30":"The children of Dan set up for themselves the carved image. Jonathan son of Gershom son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the exile from the land.","18":"Now after these had gone into Micah’s house and taken the carved image, the ephod, the household idols and the molten image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”","29":"So they called the name of the town Dan, after the name of their father Dan born to Israel; however, the former name of the town was Laish.","23":"They called out to the children of Dan, who turned their faces around and said to Micah, “What’s the matter with you that you have called them out?”","19":"“Be quiet!” they said to him. “Put your hand on your mouth and go with us and be to us a father and a priest! Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man or to be priest to a tribe and a clan in Israel?”","1":"In those days there was no king in Israel, and in those days the tribe of Dan was seeking an inheritance for itself to settle in, for to that day no territory had fallen to them for an inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel.","5":"“Please inquire of God,” they said to him, “so we may know whether our way that we are going will be successful.”","4":"He said to them, “Thus and thus Micah did for me — he hired me and I became his priest.”","8":"When they came back to their kinsmen at Zorah and Eshtaol, their kinsmen asked them, “What do you say?”","26":"Then the children of Dan went on their way, and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.","14":"Then the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish said to their kinsmen, “Do you know that in these houses there are an ephod, household idols, a carved image and a molten image? Now therefore, consider what you have to do.”","22":"When they were at a good distance from Micah’s house, the men that were in the houses near Micah’s house gathered and caught up with the children of Dan.","28":"There was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon and they had no alliance with anyone. It was in the valley near Beth-rehob. Then they rebuilt the town and lived in it.","25":"But the children of Dan said to him, “Don’t let your voice be heard among us, lest bitter fellows fall upon you, and you lose your life with the lives of your household.”","9":"“Arise, let’s go up against them!” they said. “For we have seen the land — see, it’s very good. Yet you’re sitting still! Don’t be sluggish! Go enter, possess the land!","15":"So they turned aside there and came to the house of the young Levite at Micah’s house, and asked him about his welfare.","21":"So they turned and set off, and placed the little ones and the cattle and the goods in front of them.","24":"“You have taken away my gods which I made,” he said, “and the priest, and walked away! What do I have left? And how then do you say to me, ‘What’s the matter with you?’”","16":"Now the 600 men of the children of Dan, armed with their weapons of war, were standing by the entrance of the gate.","7":"Then the five men left and came to Laish, and saw the people there living securely, like the Zidonians, tranquil and unsuspecting. For there was no humiliation or anything oppressive in the land. Moreover, they were distant from the Zidonians and had no dealings with anybody.","2":"So the children of Dan sent five men from their clan, out of their entire population, men of valor from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and explore it, and said to them, “Go, explore the land.” When they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.","6":"“Go in peace,” the priest said to them. “The way that you are going has ADONAI’s approval.”","31":"So they set them up Micah’s carved image that he had made, all the time that the House of God was in Shiloh."},"12":{"3":"So when I saw that you weren’t going to deliver, I put my life in my hand and crossed over against the children of Ammon, and ADONAI gave them into my hand. So why have you come up to me today, to fight me?”","5":"The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan opposite Ephraim. So when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead would ask him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No,”","12":"then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.","10":"then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem.","2":"So Jephthah responded to them, “I and my people were in a bitter conflict with the children of Ammon, yet when I called you, you didn’t deliver me from their hand.","8":"After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.","11":"Then after him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel. He judged Israel ten years,","1":"Then the men of Ephraim were summoned and crossed over to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross over to fight against the children of Ammon without calling us to go with you? We will burn your house over you with fire.”","9":"Now he had 30 sons, and 30 daughters — he sent them outside and brought in 30 girls from outside for his sons. He judged Israel seven years,","14":"He had 40 sons and 30 grandsons who rode on 70 donkeys, and he judged Israel eight years.","7":"Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in one of the towns of Gilead.","15":"Then Abdon son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.","6":"then they would say to him, “Say now, ‘Shibboleth,’” and he said “Sibboleth” since he could not pronounce it right, then they would seize him and slay him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time 42,000 of Ephraim fell.","4":"Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought Ephraim. The men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they said, “You Gileadites are just fugitives of Ephraim in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh.”","13":"After him Abdon son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel."},"10":{"16":"Then they removed the foreign gods from among them, and worshipped ADONAI. So His soul could not bear the misery of Israel.","3":"After him Jair the Gileadite arose, and judged Israel for 23 years.","5":"Then Jair died and was buried in Kamon.","18":"The people of the princes of Gilead said one to another, “Whoever begins to fight against the children of Ammon will be chief over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”","12":"the Zidonians, the Amalekites and the Maonites who oppressed you? When you cried out to Me, I delivered you from their hand.","10":"Then Bnei-Yisrael cried out to ADONAI saying, “We have sinned against You, for we have forsaken our God and have worshipped the Baalim.”","2":"He judged Israel for 23 years, then died and was buried in Shamir.","8":"They shattered and crushed Bnei-Yisrael that year — for 18 years all Bnei-Yisrael who were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.","17":"Then the children of Ammon were summoned and camped in Gilead. Bnei-Yisrael gathered together and camped in Mizpah.","11":"So ADONAI said to Bnei-Yisrael, “Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians, the Amorites, the children of Ammon, the Philistines,","1":"After Abimelech, Tola son of Puah son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, arose to deliver Israel. He dwelt in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.","9":"Then the children of Ammon also crossed over the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin and the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was greatly distressed.","14":"Go and cry out to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your distress.”","7":"So ADONAI’s anger burned against Israel, and He sold them over into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the children of Ammon.","15":"Then Bnei-Yisrael said to ADONAI, “We have sinned. Do to us whatever seems good to You, but please, deliver us this day.”","6":"Then Bnei-Yisrael again did what was evil in ADONAI’s eyes. They worshipped the Baalim, the Ashtaroth, gods of Aram, gods of Zidon, gods of Moab, gods of the children of Ammon and gods of the Philistines. They abandoned ADONAI and did not worship Him.","4":"He had 30 sons who rode on 30 donkeys and had 30 towns in the land of Gilead, which are called Jair’s Villages to this day.","13":"Yet you have forsaken Me and worshipped other gods; therefore I will deliver you no more."},"2":{"16":"Then ADONAI raised up judges who delivered them from the hand of those who plundered them.","3":"Therefore I also said, ‘I will not drive them out from before you, but they will be thorns in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.’”","5":"So they called the name of that place Bochim , and they sacrificed there to ADONAI.","21":"I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died,","18":"Whenever ADONAI raised judges up for them, ADONAI was with the judge and delivered them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. For ADONAI was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed and crushed them.","12":"They abandoned ADONAI, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods from among the gods of the peoples around them, and bowed down to them. So they provoked the anger of ADONAI.","10":"But when all that generation were gathered to their fathers, there arose another generation after them that did not experience ADONAI or the work that He had done for Israel.","2":"Now as for you, you must make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land. You must break down their altars.’ But you have not listened to My voice. What is this you have done?","22":"in order to test Israel by them, whether or not they will keep the way of ADONAI to walk in it as their fathers did.”","8":"Then Joshua son of Nun, the servant of ADONAI, died at the age of 110 years,","17":"Yet they listened not to their judges, for they prostituted themselves after other gods and bowed down to them. They quickly turned aside from the way in which their fathers walked in obeying the commandments of ADONAI; they did not do so.","11":"Then Bnei-Yisrael did what was evil in ADONAI’s eyes, and worshipped the Baalim.","1":"Now the angel of ADONAI came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and He said, “I brought you up out of Egypt and took you into the land which I swore to your fathers. I also said, ‘I will never break My covenant with you.","9":"and they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash.","14":"So the anger of ADONAI burned against Israel, and He gave them over to the hands of plunderers who plundered them, and He sold them over into the hand of their enemies around them, so that they could no longer stand up before their enemies.","7":"Then the people worshipped ADONAI all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of ADONAI that He had done for Israel.","15":"Whenever they went out, the hand of ADONAI was against them for evil, as ADONAI had spoken and as ADONAI had sworn to them. So they were severely distressed.","20":"So the anger of ADONAI burned against Israel, and He declared, “Since this nation has transgressed My covenant that I commanded their fathers and has not listened to My voice,","23":"So ADONAI left those nations, without driving them out quickly. Thus so He had not given them into the hand of Joshua.","6":"Now when Joshua had sent the people away, Bnei-Yisrael went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.","4":"Now when the angel of ADONAI spoke these words to all Bnei-Yisrael, the people lifted up their voice and wept.","19":"But when the judge died, they would keep turning back and acted more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods, worshipping them, and bowing down to them. They abandoned none of their practices and stubborn ways.","13":"So they forsook ADONAI and worshipped Baal and the Ashtaroth."},"8":{"11":"Now Gideon went up by the road of the tent dwellers on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and ambushed the camp when it was off guard.","3":"God has given into your hand the princes of Midian — Oreb and Zeeb — so what was I able to do compared to you?” Their anger with him subsided after he said this.","20":"Then he said to Jeter his first-born, “Arise, kill them!” But the boy could not draw his sword, for he was afraid, since he was still a youth.","12":"When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed the whole army.","10":"Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and with them their armies of about 15,000 men, all who were left of all the army of the people of the east — the fallen were 120,000 swordsmen.","17":"He also tore down the tower of Penuel and slew the men of the city.","13":"Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle by the Ascent of Heres.","27":"Gideon made it into an ephod, and put it in his town Ophrah.

ADONAI alone will rule over you.”","19":"“They were my brothers, the sons of my mother,” he said. “As ADONAI lives, if only you had let them live, I would not kill you.”","1":"Now the men of Ephraim said to him, “What is this thing you have done to us, not calling us when you went to fight against Midian?” So they criticized him sharply.","5":"He said to the men of Succoth, “Please, give loaves of bread to the people on foot with me, for they are exhausted, and I am chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”","4":"Then Gideon reached the Jordan and crossed over. He and the 300 men with him were exhausted, yet still pursuing.","8":"From there he went up to Penuel and spoke to them similarly, but the men of Penuel answered him just as the men of Succoth had answered.","26":"So the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was 1,700 shekels of gold — besides the crescent ornaments, the pendants and the purple robes that were on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were on their camels’ necks.","14":"He captured a boy from the people of Succoth and questioned him, so he wrote down for him the officials of Succoth and its elders — 77 men.","22":"Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us — you, your son, and your grandson as well.

The land had tranquility for 40 years in the days of Gideon.","25":"“We’ll certainly give them!” they replied. So they spread out a robe, and each one of them threw an earring from his spoil.","9":"So he spoke also to the men of Penuel saying, “When I come back safely, I will tear down this tower.”","33":"But it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that Bnei-Yisrael again prostituted themselves after the Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.","15":"When he came to the men of Succoth, he said, “Behold Zebah and Zalmunna — about whom you mocked me saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand?

Have you invited us to impoverish us?”","20":"But Samson’s wife was given to his companion who had been his best man.","6":"Then the Ruach ADONAI came mightily upon him, and he tore him apart as one would have split a young goat — yet he had nothing in his hand. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.","4":"But his father and mother did not know that it was of ADONAI, for He was seeking a pretext against the Philistines. For at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.","19":"Then the Ruach ADONAI came mightily upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed 30 of their men, took their spoil, and gave the changes of clothes to those who solved the riddle. Since his rage was burning, he went up to his father’s house.","13":"but if you cannot solve it for me, then you must give me 30 linen garments and 30 changes of clothes.” “Propose your riddle,” they said to him. “Let’s hear it!”"},"7":{"16":"Then he divided the 300 men into three columns, and he put into the hands of all of them shofarot and empty pitchers, with torches inside the pitchers.","3":"So now, make proclamation in the ears of the people saying, ‘Whoever is afraid or anxious may turn back and leave from Mount Gilead.’” So 22,000 people turned back, while ten thousand remained.","5":"So he brought the troops down to the water, and ADONAI said to Gideon, “You are to set apart everyone who laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, and everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.”","21":"Each one stood in his place around the camp, and then the entire army ran, shouting as they fled.","18":"When I and all that are with me blow the shofar, then you also blow the shofarot all around the camp, and say, ‘For ADONAI and for Gideon!’”","12":"Now the Midianites, the Amalekites and all the people of the east were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were countless, as numerous as the sand on the seashore.","10":"But if you are afraid to go down, first go down to the camp with your attendant Purah.","2":"But ADONAI said to Gideon, “Too many are the people who are with you, for Me to give the Midianites into their hand. Otherwise Israel would glorify itself against Me saying, ‘My own hand has delivered me.’","22":"Now when they blew the 300 shofarot, ADONAI set every man’s sword against his fellow throughout the entire army. So the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.","8":"So the 300 took provisions and their shofarot in their hands. He sent all the other men of Israel each to his tent, but he kept the 300 men. Now the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.","17":"Then he said to them, “Watch me and do likewise. So behold, when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do just as I do.","11":"Then you will hear what they are saying, and after that your hands will be strengthened to attack the camp.” So he went down with his attendant Purah to an outpost of the army that was in camp.","1":"Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him, rose up early and camped beside En-harod, while the camp of Midian was north of them, by Gibeath-moreh, in the valley.","9":"It came to pass the same night that ADONAI said to him, “Arise, get down against the camp, for I have given it into your hand.","24":"Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim saying, “Come down against Midian and seize the waters down to Beth-barah, all along the Jordan.” So all the men of Ephraim were summoned and took control of the waterside as far as Beth-barah by the Jordan.","14":"His companion answered and said, “This is nothing less than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel — God has delivered Midian and all the camp into his hand!”","7":"Then ADONAI said to Gideon, “With the 300 men who lapped I will deliver you and give the Midianites into your hand. So let all the other people go, every man to his place.”","15":"Now when Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship. Then he returned to the camp of Israel and said, “Arise! For ADONAI has given into your hand the camp of Midian.”","20":"When the three columns blew the shofarot and broke the pitchers, they held the torches in their left hands and the shofarot in their right hands to blow, and they shouted, “A sword for ADONAI and for Gideon!”","25":"Then they captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; they slew Oreb at the Rock of Oreb and they slew Zeeb at the Winepress of Zeeb. They kept pursuing Midian, and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon from across the Jordan.","23":"Then men of Israel were summoned from Naphtali, Asher and all Manasseh, and they pursued Midian.","6":"Now the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was 300 men, but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.","4":"But ADONAI said to Gideon, “The people are still too many. Bring them down to the water and I will test them for you there. Now it will be that he of whom I say to you, ‘This will go with you,’ he will go with you, but anyone of whom I say to you, ‘This one will not go with you,’ he will not go.”","19":"So Gideon and the 300 men who were with him came up to the outermost part of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just posted the watch. Then they blew the shofarot and smashed the pitchers that were in their hands.","13":"Yet when Gideon came, behold, there was a man relating a dream to his fellow, saying, “Listen, I just now had a dream: there was a loaf of barley bread that came tumbling into the camp of Midian, came up to a tent and struck it so it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.”"},"15":{"16":"Then Samson said, “With the jawbone of a donkey, a heap . . . two heaps, with the jawbone of a donkey I struck down a thousand men.”","3":"Then Samson said to them, “This time I am blameless from the Philistines when I do harm to them.”","5":"Then he set fire to the torches and released them into the standing grain of the Philistines, Thus he burned up both the stacks and the standing grain, along with vineyards and olive trees.","18":"Then he became very thirsty, so he called to ADONAI and said, “You have granted this great deliverance by the hand of Your servant. So now, will I die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?”","12":"“We have come down to bind you,” they said to him, “so that we may hand you over to the Philistines.” So Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you yourselves won’t kill me.”","10":"The men of Judah asked, “Why have you marched against us?” They replied, “We have come to arrest Samson — to do to him as he did to us.”","2":"“I thought for sure you had utterly hated her,” her father said, “so I gave her to your best man. Her younger sister — isn’t she better than her? Please, let her be yours instead.”","8":"So he struck them leg upon thigh with a great slaughter. Then he went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam.","17":"As soon as he had finished speaking, he threw the jawbone from his hand. Then he named that place Ramat-lehi.","11":"Then 3,000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam and said to Samson, “Don’t you realize that the Philistines are ruling over us? So what is this that you have done to us?” He said to them, “As they did to me, so I have done to them.”","1":"But after a while, during the time of wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a young goat. “I am going to my wife in her room,” he said. But her father would not let him enter.","9":"Then the Philistines went up and camped in Judah and spread out in Lehi.","14":"When he arrived at Lehi, the Philistines shouted upon meeting him. But the Ruach ADONAI came mightily upon him so that the ropes that were on his arms became like flax burned with fire and his bonds melted off his wrists.","7":"Then Samson said to them, “Since you have acted like this, surely I will take revenge on you — after that I will quit.”","15":"Then he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out and took it, and killed a thousand men with it.","20":"Then he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines for 20 years.","6":"Then the Philistines asked, “Who did this?” They were told, “Samson, son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his best man.” So the Philistines came up and burnt her and her father with fire.","4":"So Samson went and caught 300 foxes, and took torches, turned the foxes tail to tail and put one torch between every two tails.","19":"But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out of it. When he drank, he regained his strength and revived. Therefore he called it En-hakkore , which is in Lehi to this day.","13":"“No, we won’t kill you,” they said to him, “but we will bind you fast and hand you over to them.” So they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock."},"20":{"11":"So all the men of Israel were gathered against the town, knit together as one man.","41":"Then the men of Israel turned back, and the men of Benjamin were terrified, for they realized that disaster had struck them.","45":"Then the rest turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, but they picked off 5,000 of them on the highways. They pressed hard after them to Gidom, and struck down 2,000 more of them.","42":"Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel toward the way of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them. Meanwhile those who came from the towns massacred them in their midst.","3":"Now the children of Benjamin heard that Bnei-Yisrael had gone up to Mizpah. Bnei-Yisrael asked, “Tell us, how did this wickedness take place?”","20":"The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and arrayed for battle against Gibeah.","12":"And the tribes of Israel sent men through the tribe of Benjamin saying, “What is this wickedness that has taken place among you?","10":"We will take ten men of a hundred throughout the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to supply provisions for the troops, so that when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, they may do to them according to all the disgrace that they have committed in Israel.”","17":"Meanwhile the men of Israel, apart from Benjamin, numbered 400,000 swordsmen; all men of war.","44":"Thus 18,000 men of Benjamin fell, all them were men of valor.","40":"But when the beacon began to arise up from the town in a pillar of smoke, Benjamin looked behind them, and behold, the whole town was going up in smoke to the sky.","13":"Now therefore, give up the men, the worthless fellows that are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and purge this evil from Israel.” But the children of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their kinsmen Bnei-Yisrael.","27":"Then Bnei-Yisrael inquired of ADONAI (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,","30":"Then Bnei-Yisrael advanced against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and arrayed against Gibeah, as at other times.","18":"Then Bnei-Yisrael arose, went up to Bethel and inquired of God. They asked, “Who is to go up first to battle for us against the children of Benjamin?” ADONAI replied, “Judah first.”","36":"So the children of Benjamin realized that they were defeated. Now the men of Israel had yielded ground to Benjamin, because they relied on the ambush that they had laid against Gibeah.","29":"So Israel set men in ambush against Gibeah on all sides.","23":"Yet Bnei-Yisrael went up and wept before ADONAI until evening, then inquired of ADONAI saying, “Shall I again draw near to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?” ADONAI said, “Go up against him.”","19":"So Bnei-Yisrael rose up in the morning and camped against Gibeah.","1":"Then all Bnei-Yisrael went out and was assembled as one man, from Dan to Beersheba with the land of Gilead, before ADONAI at Mizpah.","47":"But 600 men turned and escaped into the wilderness, to the rock of Rimmon, and stayed at the rock of Rimmon four months.","5":"Then men of Gibeah rose against me and surrounded the house over me at night. They intended to kill me, but instead, they raped my concubine until she died.","4":"So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, answered and said, “I came with my concubine to Gibeah of Benjamin to spend the night.","8":"Then all the people arose as one man saying, “Not one of us will go to his tent, nor will any of us return to his house.","26":"Then all Bnei-Yisrael went up, and all the people came to Bethel and wept and sat there before ADONAI. They fasted that day until evening and they offered burnt-offerings and fellowship offerings before ADONAI.","39":"then the men of Israel would return to the battle. When Benjamin began to strike, killing about 30 of the men of Israel, they said, “Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle.”","14":"So the children of Benjamin were gathered from their towns to Gibeah, to go out to battle against Bnei-Yisrael.","37":"So the men in ambush rushed suddenly upon Gibeah, then the men in another ambush advanced and struck the whole town with the edge of the sword.","22":"But the people of the men of Israel rallied their strength and arrayed for battle again in the same place where they had arrayed themselves the first day.","28":"and Pinchas son of Eleazar son of Aaron had ministered before it in those days) saying, “Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or should I cease?” ADONAI replied, “Go up, for tomorrow I will give him into your hand.”","25":"Benjamin came out against them from Gibeah again the second day and struck down 18,000 of Bnei-Yisrael on the field — all drawing the sword.","9":"But now this is what we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot.","33":"Then all the troops of Israel rose up from their place and arrayed themselves at Baal-tamar, and the troops of Israel in ambush burst out of their place west of Geba.","15":"On that day the children of Benjamin mustered 26,000 swordsmen from the towns, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who numbered 700 chosen men.","34":"Then 10,000 troops chosen from all Israel made a frontal attack on Gibeah, and the battle became fierce; but the Benjamites did not know not that disaster was about to strike them.","21":"But the children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and struck down 22,000 men of Israel on the field that day.","24":"So Bnei-Yisrael advanced against the children of Benjamin on the second day.","46":"So all who fell that day of Benjamin were 25,000 men drawing the sword — all of them were men of valor.","16":"Out of all these troops there were 700 chosen men that were left-handed, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.","35":"Then ADONAI struck Benjamin before Israel — Bnei-Yisrael killed 25,100 of Benjamin that day, all drawing the sword.","32":"So the children of Benjamin said, “They are defeated before us as before.” But Bnei-Yisrael said, “Let us flee and draw them away from the town to the highways.”","7":"Behold, all you sons of Israel, give your advice and counsel here.”","43":"They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them and easily overtook them, near Gibeah toward the east.","48":"The men of Israel turned back against the children of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword — the entire city, the cattle and all that they found. They also set on fire all the towns that they found.","2":"The chiefs of the people and of the tribes of Israel presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God — 400,000 foot soldiers armed with swords.","38":"Now there was a prearranged sign between the men of Israel and the men in ambush — they would make a great beacon of smoke rise up from the town —","6":"So I took my concubine and cut her into pieces and sent her throughout the land of Israel’s possession. For they have committed something obscene and degrading in Israel.","31":"The children of Benjamin came out against the people, but they were drawn away from the town, and they began to strike and kill some of the people (about 30 men of Israel), as at other times, on the highways, of which one goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah."},"6":{"11":"Then the angel of ADONAI came and sat under the terebinth that was at Ophrah, that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress — in order to hide it from the Midianites.","3":"Whenever Israel had done their sowing, the Midianites, Amalekites and people from the east would come up and raid them.","20":"Then the angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the matzah and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” So he did so.","12":"Then the angel of ADONAI appeared to him and said to him, “ADONAI is with you, O mighty man of valor.”","10":"Then I said to you, “I am ADONAI your God. You are not to fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are dwelling. But you have not obeyed My voice.’”","17":"Then he said to Him, “If now I have found favor in Your eyes, then please, show me a sign that it is really You talking with me.","40":"God did so that night, since it was dry only on the fleece, and there was dew over all the ground.","13":"But Gideon said to him, “O my lord, if ADONAI is with us, then why has all this befallen us? So where are all His wonders that our fathers told us about saying ‘Didn’t ADONAI bring us up from Egypt?’ But now ADONAI has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian.”","27":"So Gideon took ten of his male servants and did as ADONAI had spoken to him. But since he was too afraid of his father’s household and the townspeople to do it by day, he did it at night.","30":"Then the townspeople said to Joash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal, and even cut down the Asherah pole that was beside it.”","18":"Please, don’t leave from here, until I come to You and bring out my offering and lay it before You.” So He said, “I will stay until you come back.”","36":"Then Gideon said to God, “If You are going to deliver Israel by my hand, as You have spoken,","29":"So they said one to another, “Who did this thing?” And when they inquired and asked around, they said: “Gideon son of Joash did this thing.”","23":"But ADONAI said to him, “Shalom to you. Fear not, you will not die.”","19":"Then Gideon went in and prepared a kid and matzot from an ephah of flour. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, and brought them out to Him under the terebinth and presented them.","1":"Then Bnei-Yisrael did what was evil in ADONAI’s eyes, so ADONAI gave them into the hand of Midian for seven years.","5":"For they would come up with their cattle and their tents, invade like a multitude of locusts. Both they and their camels were innumerable, and they would come to the land to ruin it.","4":"They would set up camp by them, destroy the produce of the land as far as Gaza, and leave nothing in Israel to live on — not a sheep, ox or donkey.","8":"that ADONAI sent a prophet to Bnei-Yisrael, and he said to them, “Thus says ADONAI, God of Israel, ‘It was I who brought you up from Egypt, and brought you out of the house of bondage.","26":"build an altar to ADONAI your God on the top of this stronghold in an orderly manner, and take the second bull and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah pole that you will cut down.”","39":"Then Gideon said to God, “Let not Your anger burn against me if I speak once more. Let me please test once more with the fleece — let it now be dry only on the fleece, but let there be dew over all the ground.”","14":"Then ADONAI turned toward him and said, “Go in this might of yours and deliver Israel from the hand of Midian. Have not I sent you?”","37":"see, I am putting a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor. If there is dew only on the fleece, and all the ground is dry, then I will know that You will deliver Israel by my hand, as You have spoken.”","22":"When Gideon realized that He was the angel of ADONAI, Gideon said, “Alas, my Lord ADONAI! For I have seen the angel of ADONAI face to face!”","28":"Now when the townspeople arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, the Asherah pole that was beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered up on the altar that was built.","25":"Now it came to pass the same night that ADONAI said to him, “Take the young bull that belongs to your father and a second bull of seven years old, pull down the altar of Baal that belongs to your father, cut down the Asherah that is beside it,","9":"Then I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all your oppressors, and drove them out from before you and gave you their land.","33":"Now all the Midianites, the Amalekites and the people of the east gathered together, crossed over and camped in the valley of Jezreel.","15":"Then he said to him, “Me, my Lord? With what would I deliver Israel? Look, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.”","34":"But the Ruach ADONAI clothed Gideon, and he blew the shofar, and Abiezer rallied behind him.","21":"Then the angel of ADONAI put out the end of the staff that was in His hand and touched the meat and the matzah. Fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the matzah. Then the angel of ADONAI vanished from his sight.","24":"So Gideon built an altar there to ADONAI and called it “ADONAI-shalom.” To this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.","16":"But ADONAI said to him, “Surely I will be with you, and you will strike down Midian as if it were one man.”","35":"Then he sent messengers throughout Manasseh, and they also rallied behind him. Then he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, and they came up to join them.","32":"So on that day he was called Jerubbaal saying, “Let Baal contend with him, since he broke down his altar.”","7":"Now it came about when Bnei-Yisrael cried out to ADONAI because of Midian,","2":"Midian maintained an upper hand over Israel, and because of Midian Bnei-Yisrael made themselves hideouts in the mountains — caves and strongholds.","38":"And it was so. When he rose up early next day, he squeezed the fleece and wrung dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water.","6":"So Israel was brought very low because of Midian, and Bnei-Yisrael cried out to ADONAI.","31":"But Joash said to all who stood against him, “So you’re going to defend Baal?

His army commander was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-ha-goyim .","22":"Now behold, as Barak was pursuing Sisera, Yael came out to meet him and said to him, “Come, I will show you the man whom you are seeking.” So he entered with her, and behold, Sisera was lying dead, with a tent-pin in his temple!","8":"But Barak said to her, “If you are going with me, then I will go.

There was a certain Levite dwelling in a remote part of the hill country of Ephraim, who got himself a concubine out of Bethlehem in Judah.","5":"Now on the fourth day they woke up early in the morning, and he rose up to depart, but the young woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward you may go.”","4":"His father-in-law, the young woman’s father, kept him staying with him three days, eating, drinking and lodging there.","8":"Then he woke up early in the morning on the fifth day to depart, but the young woman’s father said, “Please, strengthen yourself and tarry until afternoon!” So both of them ate.","26":"As the morning came, the woman came and fell down at the doorway of the man’s house where her master was, until it was full daylight.","14":"So they passed on and went their way, and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.","22":"While they were making their hearts merry, behold, some worthless men of the town surrounded the house. Pounding the door, they shouted to the owner of the house, “Bring out the man that came into your house,” they said to the old man, “so we may have relations with him.”","28":"“Get up!” he said to her, “and let’s go.” But there was no response. So he placed her on the donkey. Then the man got up and went to his place.","25":"But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine and brought her out to them, and they raped her and abused her all the night until morning. When dawn broke, they let her go.","9":"And when the man rose up to depart, he and his concubine and his servant, his father-in-law, the young woman’s father, said to him, “Behold now, the day is waning toward evening; please, spend the night. Behold, the day is drawing to a close; lodge here and let your heart be merry. Then tomorrow get up early for your journey so that you may go home.”","15":"Then they turned aside there to enter and lodge in Gibeah. When he went in, he sat down in the town square, for there was no one who took them into his house to spend the night.","21":"So he brought him into his house and gave the donkeys fodder, and they washed their feet and ate and drank.","24":"Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine — I will bring them out to you now, and you may abuse them and do to them whatever pleases you, but don’t do such a degrading thing to this man!”","16":"Now behold, an old man was coming from his work in the field at evening. The man was of the hill country of Ephraim but dwelled in Gibeah, while the rest of the men of the place were Benjamites.","7":"Then the man rose up to depart, but his father-in-law urged him, so he lodged there again.","2":"But his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him to her father’s house to Bethlehem in Judah, and was there for a period of four months.","6":"So the two of them sat down and ate and drank together. Then the young woman’s father said to the man, “Please, be willing to spend the night, and let your heart be merry.”"},"13":{"16":"But the angel of ADONAI said to Manoah, “If you could detain me, I would not eat your food. But if you present a burnt offering, then offer it to ADONAI.” For Manoah did not realize that he was the angel of ADONAI.","3":"Then the angel of ADONAI appeared to the woman and said to her, “Behold now, you are barren and have not borne children, but you will conceive and bear a son.","5":"For behold, you will conceive and bear a son. Let no razor come upon his head, for the boy will be a Nazirite to God from the womb.  He will begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.”","21":"But the angel of ADONAI appeared no more to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah realized that he was the angel of ADONAI.","18":"But the angel of ADONAI said to him, “Why do you ask for my name? It is wonderful.”","12":"Then Manoah said, “Now may your words come about! What will be the child’s rule and his mission?”","10":"So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, and said to him, “Look, the man that came to me the other day has appeared to me!”","2":"Now there was a certain man from Zorah, from a Danite clan, whose name was Manoah. His wife was barren and bore no children.","22":"Manoah said to his wife, “We will surely die, because we have seen God.”","8":"Then Manoah entreated ADONAI and said, “My Lord, please let the man of God whom You have sent come to us again and teach us what we will do for the boy to be born.”","17":"Then Manoah asked the angel of ADONAI, “What is your name, so that when your words come to pass we may honor you?”","11":"So Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he asked him, “Are you the one who spoke to the woman?” “I am,” he said.","1":"Bnei-Yisrael again did what was evil in ADONAI’s eyes, and ADONAI gave them into the hand of the Philistines for 40 years.","9":"God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she was sitting in the field, but her husband Manoah was not with her.","24":"Then the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson. So the boy grew up and ADONAI blessed him.","14":"She should not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, or drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing. She must observe all that I commanded her.”","7":"He said to me, ‘Behold, you will conceive and bear a son. So, drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the child will be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.”","15":"Then Manoah said to the angel of ADONAI, “Please, let us detain you so that we may prepare a young goat for you.”","20":"For it came about when the flame went up from off the altar toward heaven that the angel of ADONAI ascended in the flame of the altar. Manoah and his wife were looking on, then they fell on their faces to the ground.","25":"The Ruach ADONAI began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.","23":"But his wife said to him, “If ADONAI had desired to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a meal offering from our hand, nor would He have shown us all these things or let us hear such things as these at this time.”","6":"Then the woman came and told her husband saying, “A man of God came to me and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome! But I did not ask him where he was from, nor did he tell me his name.","4":"Now therefore be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing.","19":"Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering and offered them on the rock to ADONAI, and He did something wonderful as Manoah and his wife were watching.","13":"The angel of ADONAI said to Manoah, “Let the woman abstain from all that I mentioned to her."}}}
