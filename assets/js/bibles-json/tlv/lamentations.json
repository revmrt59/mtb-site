For the cedar has fallen. Those majestic ones are devastated. Wail, oaks of Bashan! For the thick forest is cut down!","8":"Next I disposed of the three shepherds in one month — for my soul was impatient with them and their soul also detested me.","17":"Woe to the worthless shepherd who deserts the flock!  May a sword fell his arm and his right eye! May his arm be all withered and his right eye totally blinded!”","11":"It was broken on that day. The afflicted of the flock that were watching me knew that this was the word of ADONAI.”","1":"Open your gates, Lebanon — fire will devour your cedars!","9":"Then I said, “I will not shepherd you!

They will be like gems of a crown sparkling over His land.","3":"Tyre built herself a fortress and heaped up silver like dust and fine gold like dirt in the streets.","5":"Ashkelon will see it and fear. Gaza will writhe in pain as will Ekron because her hope will dry up. The king will perish from Gaza and Ashkelon will be uninhabited.","12":"Return to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope! Today I declare that I will restore twice as much to you.","10":"I will banish chariots from Ephraim and horses from Jerusalem, and the war bow will be broken. He will speak shalom to the nations.

No oppressor will overrun them again — for now I watch with My own eyes.","17":"How good and beautiful it will be! Grain will make the young men thrive and new wine the virgin women.”","11":"As for you also, by the blood of your covenant,  I will release your prisoners from the waterless Pit.","1":"The burden  of the word of ADONAI is against the land of Hadrach and will rest upon Damascus. For the eyes of men and all the tribes of Israel are toward ADONAI —","9":"Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion! Shout, daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you, a righteous one bringing salvation. He is lowly, riding on a donkey — on a colt, the foal of a donkey.","14":"Then ADONAI will be seen over them as His arrow flashes like lightning. ADONAI Elohim will blow the shofar and march in whirlwinds of the south.","7":"I will remove the blood from his mouth, forbidden food from between his teeth. Whoever is left will be a remnant for our God. He will be like a leader in Judah, and Ekron will be like a Jebusite.","15":"ADONAI-Tzva’ot will defend them.

Then ADONAI my God will come and all the kedoshim with Him.","21":"In fact every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be Holy to ADONAI-Tzva’ot, so that everyone who comes to sacrifice will take them, and cook in them. In that day there will no longer be a Canaanite  in the House of ADONAI-Tzva’ot.","18":"If the Egyptians do not go up and celebrate, they will have no rain. Instead, there will be the plague that ADONAI will inflict on the nations that do not go up to celebrate Sukkot.","12":"Now this is the plague with which ADONAI will strike all the peoples that wage war against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot while they are standing on their feet; their eyes will rot in their sockets; and their tongues will rot in their mouths.","10":"The whole land, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem, will become like the Arabah.
