We wailed, but you did not mourn.’","13":"For all the prophets and the Torah prophesied until the time of John.","27":"“All things have been handed over to Me by My Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son  and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.","30":"For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”","18":"“For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon!’","29":"Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and ‘you will find rest for your souls.’","23":"And you, Capernaum? Will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will go down to Sheol! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.","19":"The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.”","1":"When Yeshua had finished instructing His twelve disciples, He went on from there to teach and preach in their towns.","5":"the blind see and the lame walk, those with tzara’at are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised and the poor have good news proclaimed to them.","4":"Yeshua replied, “Go report to John what you hear and see:","8":"No? So what did you go out to see? A man dressed in finery? Look, those who wear finery are in the palaces of kings!","26":"Yes, Father, for this way was pleasing to You.","14":"And if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come.","22":"Nevertheless I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the Day of Judgment than for you.","28":"Come to Me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.","25":"At that time Yeshua said in response, “I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and discerning and revealed them to infants.","9":"Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, even more than a prophet.","15":"He who has ears, let him hear!","21":"“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon,  they would have turned long ago in sackcloth and ashes.","24":"Nevertheless I tell you that it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom on the Day of Judgment than for you.”","16":"“But to what shall I compare this generation? It’s like children sitting in the marketplaces who call to one other, saying,","7":"Now as they were leaving, Yeshua began to talk to the crowd concerning John. “What did you go out to the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?","2":"Now when John heard in prison about the works of the Messiah, he sent word through his disciples","6":"Blessed is the one who is not led to stumble because of Me.”"},"3":{"16":"After being immersed, Yeshua rose up out of the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Ruach Elohim  descending like a dove and coming upon Him.","3":"For he is the one Isaiah the prophet spoke about, saying, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of ADONAI, and make His paths straight.’”","5":"Then Jerusalem was going out to him, and all Judea and all the region around the Jordan.","12":"His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He shall clear His threshing floor and gather His wheat into the barn; but the chaff He shall burn up with inextinguishable fire.”","10":"Already the axe is laid at the root of the trees; therefore every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire!","2":"“Turn away from your sins, for the kingdom of heaven is near!”","8":"Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance;","17":"And behold, a voice from the heavens said, “This is My Son, whom I love; with Him I am well pleased!”","11":"“As for me, I immerse you in water for repentance. But the One coming after me is mightier than I am; I am not worthy to carry His sandals. He will immerse you in the Ruach ha-Kodesh and fire.","1":"In those days, John the Immerser came proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea,","9":"and do not think that you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father’! For I tell you that from these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.","14":"But John tried to prevent Him, saying, “I need to be immersed by You, and You are coming to me?”","7":"But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion, he said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?","15":"But Yeshua responded, “Let it happen now, for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” So John yielded to Him.","6":"Confessing their sins, they were being immersed by him in the Jordan River.","4":"Now John wore clothing from camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts  and wild honey.","13":"Then Yeshua came from the Galilee to John, to be immersed by him in the Jordan."},"20":{"11":"“But when they received it, they began to grumble against the master of the house,","3":"And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing in the marketplace, idle.","20":"Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came with her sons to Yeshua, and she was kneeling down and asking something from Him.","12":"saying, ‘These last guys did one hour, and you’ve made them equal to us, who bore the burden and scorching heat of the day!’","10":"And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; yet they too received a denarius.","17":"Now as Yeshua was going up to Jerusalem, He took the Twelve aside privately; and on the way he told them,","13":"“But answering, he said to one of them, ‘Friend, I’m doing you no wrong. Didn’t you agree with me on a denarius?","27":"and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave —","30":"And here two blind men sitting by the roadside, when they heard that Yeshua was passing by, cried out, saying, “Have mercy on us, O Master, Ben-David!”","18":"“Look, we’re going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the ruling kohanim and Torah scholars. They will condemn Him to death","29":"Now as they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him.","23":"He said to them, “You shall indeed drink My cup. But to sit on My right and left, this isn’t Mine to grant. Rather, it’s for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father.”","19":"and hand Him over to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify. Yet on the third day, He will be raised up.”","1":"“For the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.","5":"So they went. Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did the same.","4":"And to them he said, ‘You go into the vineyard too, and I’ll give you whatever is right.’","8":"“Now when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.’","26":"It shall not be this way among you. But whoever wants to be great among you shall be your servant,","14":"Take what is yours and go. But I want to give this last guy the same as you.","22":"But Yeshua replied, “You don’t know what you’re asking! Are you able to drink the cup I am about to drink?” “We are able,” they say to Him.","28":"just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.”","25":"But Yeshua called them over and said, “You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their great ones play the tyrant over them.","9":"And those who had come about the eleventh hour each received a denarius.","33":"They said to Him, “Master, let our eyes be opened!”","15":"Am I not permitted to do what I want with what belongs to me? Or is your eye evil because I am good?’","34":"Moved with compassion, Yeshua touched their eyes. Instantly they regained their sight and followed Him.","21":"“What do you want?” He said to her. She said to Him, “Declare that these two sons of mine might sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your kingdom.”","24":"Now when the ten heard, they became indignant with the two brothers.","16":"“So the last will be first, and the first last.”","32":"Yeshua stopped and called out to them. “What do you want Me to do for you?” He said.","7":"“‘Because no one hired us,’ they said to him. “He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard, too.’","2":"Now when he had agreed with the workers for a denarius per day, he sent them into his vineyard.","6":"And about the eleventh hour, he went out and found others standing around. And he said to them, ‘Why have you been standing here idle the whole day?’","31":"The crowd warned them to be quiet, but they cried out all the more, saying, “Have mercy on us, O Master, Ben-David!”"},"12":{"11":"He said to them, “What man among you will not grab his sheep and lift it out, if it falls into a pit on Shabbat?","41":"The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And behold, something greater than Jonah is here.","45":"Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there. And that man’s last condition becomes worse than the first. So also will it be for this evil generation.”","42":"The Queen of the South  will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, something greater than Solomon is here.","3":"But He said to them, “Haven’t you read what David did when he became hungry, and those with him?","20":"A crushed reed He will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, until He brings forth justice to victory.","12":"How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is permitted to do good on Shabbat.”","10":"A man with a withered hand was there. And so that they might accuse Him, they questioned Yeshua, saying, “Is it permitted to heal on Shabbat?”","17":"This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,","44":"Then it says, ‘I’ll go back home where I came from.’ And when it comes, it finds the house vacant, swept clean, and put in order.","40":"For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights,  so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.","13":"Then He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out and it was restored, as healthy as the other.","27":"And if I drive out demons by beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? For this reason, they will be your judges.","30":"He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.","18":"“Here is My servant whom I chose, the One I love, in whom My soul takes delight. I will put My Ruach upon Him, and He shall proclaim justice to the nations.","36":"But I tell you that on the Day of Judgment, men will give account for every careless word they speak.","29":"Or how can one enter a strong man’s house and carry off his property, unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he will thoroughly plunder his house.","23":"All the crowds were astounded and saying, “This can’t be Ben-David, can it?”","19":"He will not quarrel or cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.","1":"At that time Yeshua went through the grain fields on Shabbat. His disciples became hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and eat them.","47":"Someone said to Him, “Look, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, trying to speak to You.”","5":"Or haven’t you read in the Torah that on Shabbat the kohanim in the Temple break Shabbat and yet are innocent?","49":"Stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, “Here are My mother and My brothers.","4":"How he entered into the house of God, and they ate the showbread, which was not permitted for him to eat, nor for those with him, but only for the kohanim?","8":"For the Son of Man is Lord of Shabbat.”","26":"If satan drives out satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?","39":"But Yeshua replied to them, “An evil and adulterous generation clamors for a sign, yet no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.","14":"But the Pharisees went out and plotted against Him, how they might destroy Him.","37":"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”","22":"Then a demon-plagued man, who was blind and mute, was brought to Yeshua; and He healed him, so that he spoke and saw.","28":"But if I drive out demons by the Ruach Elohim, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.","25":"Knowing their thoughts, Yeshua said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.","9":"Leaving from there, He went into their synagogue.","33":"“Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten; for the tree is known by its fruit.","15":"Knowing this, Yeshua went away from there. And large crowds followed Him, and He healed them all.","34":"You brood of vipers! How can you who are evil say anything good? For from the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks.","21":"And in His name the nations shall hope.”","24":"But hearing this, the Pharisees said, “This fellow drives out demons only by beelzebul, the ruler of demons.”","46":"While Yeshua was still speaking to the crowds, His mother and brothers were standing outside, trying to speak to Him.","16":"And He sternly warned them not to make Him known.","35":"The good man from his good treasury brings forth good, and the evil man from his evil treasury brings forth evil.","32":"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Ruach ha-Kodesh will not be forgiven, neither in this age nor in the one to come.”","7":"If you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’  you wouldn’t have condemned the innocent.","43":"“Now when an unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places looking for rest and doesn’t find it.","48":"But to the one telling Him this, Yeshua responded, “Who is My mother? And who are My brothers?”","2":"But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to Him, “Look, Your disciples are doing what is not permitted on Shabbat.”","38":"Then some of the Torah scholars and Pharisees answered Him, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.”","50":"For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven, he is My brother and sister and mother.”","6":"But I tell you that something greater than the Temple is here.","31":"“For this reason I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but blasphemy against the Ruach will not be forgiven."},"10":{"11":"“Whatever town or village you shall enter, find out who in it is worthy and stay there until you leave.","41":"He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward, and he who receives a tzaddik in the name of a tzaddik shall receive a tzaddik’s reward.","42":"And whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, amen I tell you, he shall never lose his reward.”","3":"Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; Jacob, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;","20":"For it is not you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.","12":"As you come into the house, greet it.","10":"or a bag for the journey, or two shirts,  or sandals, or a walking stick; for the worker is entitled to his food.","17":"But beware of men, for they will hand you over to the courts and flog  you in their synagogues.","40":"“He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives the One who sent Me.","13":"If the household is worthy, let your shalom come upon it. But if it’s not worthy, let your shalom return to you.","27":"What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear in your ear, proclaim from the housetops!","30":"But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.","18":"You will be brought before governors and kings because of Me, as a witness to them and to the Gentiles.","36":"and a man’s enemies will be the members of his household.’","29":"“Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?  Yet not one of them shall fall to the ground apart from your Father’s consent.","23":"Whenever they persecute you in one city, flee to the next. Amen, I tell you, you will never finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.","19":"But when they hand you over, do not worry about how or what you should say, for it shall be given to you in that hour what you should say.","1":"Yeshua summoned His twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so they could drive them out and heal every kind of disease and sickness.","5":"Yeshua sent out these twelve and ordered them, “Do not go to the Gentiles, and do not enter into any Samaritan town.","4":"Simon the Zealot,  and Judah the man from Kriot,  the one who also betrayed Him.","8":"Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those with tzara’at, drive out demons. Freely you received, freely give.","26":"“So do not fear them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed and nothing hidden that will not be made known.","39":"He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it.","14":"And whoever will not receive you or listen to your words, as you leave that house or that town, shake the dust off your feet.","37":"“He who loves father or mother more than Me isn’t worthy of Me, and he who loves son or daughter more than Me isn’t worthy of Me.","22":"And you will be hated by all because of My name, but the one who endures to the end shall be saved.","28":"And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear the One who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.","25":"It is enough for the disciple to become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the head of the house beelzebul, how much more the members of his household!","9":"Do not get gold or silver or copper for your money belts,","33":"But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven.","15":"Amen, I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah  on the Day of Judgment than for that town.","34":"“Do not think that I came to bring shalom on the earth; I did not come to bring shalom, but a sword.","21":"“Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against their parents and have them put to death.","24":"“A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master.","16":"“Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.","35":"For I have come to set ‘a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;","32":"“Therefore whoever acknowledges Me before men, I will also acknowledge him before My Father who is in heaven.","7":"As you go, proclaim, ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near!’","2":"Now these are the names of the twelve emissaries: first, Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew; Jacob the son of Zebedee and John his brother;","38":"And whoever does not take up his cross and follow after Me isn’t worthy of Me.","6":"But go instead to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.","31":"So do not fear; you are worth more than many sparrows."},"17":{"11":"Yeshua replied, “Indeed, Elijah is coming and will restore all things.","3":"And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Yeshua.","20":"And He said to them, “Because you trust so little.

In the same way, the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands.”","10":"The disciples questioned Him, saying, “Why then do the Torah scholars say that Elijah must come first?”","17":"And answering, Yeshua said, “O faithless and twisted generation!  How long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you?

Listen to Him!”","4":"Peter responded to Yeshua, “Master, it’s good for us to be here! If You wish, I will make three sukkot here — one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”","8":"And lifting their eyes, they saw no one except Yeshua alone.","26":"After Peter said, “From strangers,” Yeshua said to him, “Then the sons are free.","14":"When they came to the crowd, a man came to Yeshua, falling on his knees before Him and saying,","22":"Now while they were gathering in the Galilee, Yeshua said to them, “The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men;","25":"“Yes,” Peter said. Now when Peter came into the house, Yeshua spoke to him first, saying, “What do you think, Simon? The kings of the earth, from whom do they collect tolls or tax? From their sons or from strangers?”","9":"As they were coming down from the mountain, Yeshua commanded them, saying, “Do not tell anyone about the vision until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.”","15":"“Master, have mercy on my son, for he has seizures and suffers badly. For he often falls into the fire and often into the water.","21":"()","24":"When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the Temple tax came to Peter and said, “Your teacher pays the Temple tax,  doesn’t He?”","16":"I brought him to Your disciples, but they couldn’t heal him.”","7":"But Yeshua came and touched them. “Get up,” He said. “Stop being afraid.”","2":"Now He was transfigured before them; His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light.","6":"When the disciples heard this, they fell face down, terrified."},"13":{"11":"And He replied to them, “To you has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.","41":"The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all stumbling blocks  and those who practice lawlessness.","45":"“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls.","42":"They will throw them into the fiery furnace ; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","3":"And He told them many things in parables, saying, “Behold, a sower went out to spread some seed.","20":"“The one sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.","56":"And His sisters, aren’t they all with us? So where does He get all these things?”","12":"For whoever has, to him more will be given and he will have plenty. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.","10":"Then the disciples came to Him and said, “Why do You speak to them in parables?”","17":"Amen, I tell you, many a prophet and tzaddik longed to see what you are seeing and did not see, and to hear what you are hearing and did not hear.”","51":"“Have you understood all these things?” They said to Him, “Yes.”","44":"“The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid. And because of his joy, he goes out and sells all that he has and buys that field.","40":"Therefore just as the weeds are gathered up and burned with fire, so shall it be at the end of the age.","13":"For this reason I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear nor do they understand.","27":"So the slaves of the landowner came and said to him, ‘Master, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?’","30":"Let both grow together until the harvest. At harvest time, I will tell the reapers, “First, gather up the weeds and tie them in bundles to burn them up; but gather the wheat into my barn.’”","53":"Now when Yeshua had finished these parables, He left that place.","18":"“You then, hear the parable of the sower.","36":"Then He sent the crowds away and went into the house. His disciples came to Him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.”","29":"But he says, ‘No, for while you are gathering up the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them.","23":"“Now the one sown on the good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands. He indeed bears fruit, yielding a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty times what was sown.”","19":"When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and doesn’t understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the one having been sown along the road.","1":"On that day after Yeshua left the house, He was sitting by the sea.","47":"“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea, gathering things of every kind.","5":"Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they didn’t have much soil. They sprang up immediately, because the soil wasn’t deep.","54":"Coming into His hometown, He began to teach them in their synagogue so that they were amazed. “Where did this fellow get this wisdom and these mighty works?” they said.","52":"Then He said to them, “Therefore every Torah scholar discipled for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new things and old.”","49":"So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous","4":"As he was scattering the seed, some seeds fell by the road; and the birds came and ate them up.","8":"But others fell on good soil and were producing fruit. They yielded a crop — some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.","58":"And He did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.","26":"Now when the stalk sprouted and produced grain, then the weeds also appeared.","39":"The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.","14":"“And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, ‘You will keep on hearing but will never understand; you will keep looking, but will never see.","37":"He answered, “The one sowing the good seed is the Son of Man,","22":"“But the one sown among the thorns, this is the one who hears the word; and the worries of the world and the seduction of wealth choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.","28":"But he replied, ‘An enemy did this.’ Now the slaves say to him, ‘Do you want us, then, to go out and gather them up?’","25":"But while the men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.","9":"He who has ears,  let him hear.”","33":"He told them another parable, “The kingdom of heaven is like hametz, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened.”","15":"For the heart of this people has become dull, their ears can barely hear, and they have shut their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts. Then they would turn back, and I would heal them.’","34":"All these things Yeshua spoke to the crowds in parables. And apart from a parable, He wasn’t speaking to them,","21":"Yet he has no root himself but lasts only a short while; and when trouble or persecution comes because of the word, immediately he falls away.","57":"And they took offense at Him. But Yeshua said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own house.”","24":"He presented to them another parable, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.","46":"Upon finding a pearl of great value, he went out and sold all that he had and bought it.","16":"“But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.","35":"in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet, saying, “I will open My mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world.”","32":"It’s the smallest of all seeds; yet when it’s full grown, it’s greater than the other herbs. It becomes like a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.”","7":"Other seeds fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew and choked them out.","43":"Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun  in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear!","48":"When it was filled, they pulled it ashore; and they sat down and gathered up the good into containers, but threw the bad away.","2":"And large crowds gathered around Him; so He got into a boat and sat down, and the whole crowd stood on the shore.","38":"and the field is the world.

He filled it with sour wine and put it on a stick, and was offering it to Yeshua to drink.","21":"But the governor responded, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Bar-Abba!”","56":"Among them were Miriam from Magdala, Miriam the mother of Jacob and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.","46":"About the ninth hour Yeshua cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?”  that is, “My God, My God, why have You abandoned Me?”","32":"As they came out, they found a man from Cyrene, Simon by name. They forced him into service, to carry Yeshua’s cross-beam.","31":"When they finished mocking Him, they stripped the robe off Him and put His own clothes back on Him.

And they brought to Him all the sick — those tormented by various diseases and afflictions, those plagued by demons, the epileptics, the paralyzed — and He healed them.","14":"This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,","7":"Yeshua said to him, “Again it is written, ‘You shall not put ADONAI your God to the test.’”","15":"“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations —","20":"Immediately they left their nets and followed Him.","25":"And large crowds followed Him from the Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.","23":"Yeshua was going throughout all the Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the Good News of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and sickness among the people.","6":"“If You are Ben-Elohim,” he said, “throw Yourself down. For it is written, ‘He shall command His angels concerning you,’  and ‘upon their hands they shall lift you up, so that you may not strike your foot against a stone.’”","4":"But He replied, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”","19":"And He said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.”","13":"Leaving Natzeret, He came and settled in Capernaum, which is by the sea in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali."},"8":{"11":"Moreover, I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and they will recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.","3":"Yeshua stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing. Be cleansed.” Immediately his tzara’at was cleansed.","20":"Yeshua tells him, “Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.”","12":"But the sons of the kingdom will be driven out into the outer darkness; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”","10":"Now when Yeshua heard this, He marveled and said to those who were following, “Amen, I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith!","17":"So was fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “He Himself took our sicknesses and carried away our diseases.”","13":"Then Yeshua said to the centurion, “Go. As you have believed, let it be done for you.” And the servant was healed in that same hour.","27":"The men were amazed, saying, “What kind of person is this? Even the winds and the sea obey Him!”","30":"Now a large herd of pigs was feeding some distance away from them.","18":"Now when Yeshua saw a crowd around Him, He gave orders to go to the other side of the sea.","29":"And they screamed, “What’s between You and us,  Ben-Elohim? Have You come here to torment us, before the appointed time?”","23":"As He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him.","19":"Then a Torah scholar came to Him and said, “Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.”","1":"When He came down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him.","5":"Now when Yeshua came into Capernaum, a centurion came begging for help.","4":"And Yeshua said to him, “See that you tell no one; but go show yourself to the kohen and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”","8":"But the centurion said, “Master, I’m not worthy to have You come under my roof. But just say the word and my servant will be healed.","26":"He said to them, “Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?” Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it became totally calm.","14":"And when Yeshua came into Peter’s house, He saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying down, sick with a fever.","22":"But Yeshua tells him, “Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”","28":"When He came to the other side, into the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-plagued men coming from the graveyard  met Him. They were so violent that no one could pass by that way.","25":"So they came and woke Him up, saying, “Master, save us! We’re perishing!”","9":"For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”","33":"The herdsmen ran away, went into the town, and told everything, including what had happened to the demon-plagued men.","15":"Yeshua touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and began to take care of Him.","34":"The whole town came out to meet Yeshua. And when they saw him, they begged Him to leave their region.","21":"Then another of the disciples said, “Master, first let me go and bury my father.”","24":"Suddenly a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being covered by the waves. But Yeshua kept on sleeping.","16":"When evening came, the people brought to Him many who were afflicted by demons. He forced out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick.","32":"And He told them, “Go!” So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the cliff into the sea and drowned.","7":"Yeshua said to him, “I’ll come and heal him.”","2":"And a man with tzara’at came to Him and bowed down before Him, saying, “Master, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”","6":"“Master,” he said, “my servant is lying at home paralyzed, horribly tormented.”","31":"The demons kept begging Him, “If You drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”"},"26":{"10":"But Yeshua, knowing this, said to them, “Why do you cause trouble for this woman? She’s done Me a mitzvah.","63":"But Yeshua kept silent. The kohen gadol said to Him, “I charge You under oath by the living God, tell us if You are Mashiach Ben-Elohim!”","30":"After singing the Hallel,  they went out to the Mount of Olives.","49":"And immediately Judah drew near  to Yeshua and said, “Shalom, Rabbi!” and kissed Him.","62":"The kohen gadol stood up and said to Yeshua, “Have You no answer? What’s this they’re testifying against You?”","22":"And being very sorrowful, they began, each one, to say to Him, “I’m not the one, am I, Master?”","13":"Amen, I tell you, wherever this Good News is proclaimed in all the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”","47":"While Yeshua was still speaking, here came Judah, one of the Twelve, and with him a big crowd with swords and clubs, from the ruling kohanim and elders of the people.","71":"When he went onto the porch, another servant girl saw him and said to those who were there, “This man was with Yeshua ha-Natzrati.”","73":"A little while later, some of the bystanders approached Peter and said to him, “Surely you’re one of them, too — your accent gives you away.”","3":"Then the ruling kohanim and elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the kohen gadol named Caiaphas.","8":"But when the disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, “Why this waste?","12":"For when she poured this oil on My body, she did it to prepare Me for burial.","65":"Then the kohen gadol tore his clothes and said, “Blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, you’ve heard the blasphemy.","40":"Then He comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping; and He tells Peter, “So couldn’t you keep watch with Me for one hour?","14":"Then one of the Twelve, the one called Judah of Kriot, went to the ruling kohanim","26":"Now while they were eating, Yeshua took matzah;  and after He offered the bracha, He broke and gave to the disciples and said, “Take, eat; this is My body.”","17":"Now on the first day of matzah,  the disciples came to Yeshua, saying, “Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?”","28":"for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the removal of sins.","36":"Then Yeshua comes with them to a place called Gethsemane, and He tells the disciples, “Sit here, while I go over there and pray.”","4":"They plotted together in order that they might seize Yeshua by stealth and kill Him.","50":"“Friend,” Yeshua said to him, “do what you’ve come to do.” Then they came up and threw their hands on Yeshua and seized Him.","45":"Then He comes to the disciples and says to them, “Still sleeping? Taking your rest? Look, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners.","60":"But they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward","38":"Then He tells them, “My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with Me.”","23":"And He replied, “The one who dipped his hand in the bowl with Me, he’s the one who will betray Me.","51":"And suddenly, one of those with Yeshua stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and he struck the kohen gadol’s servant and cut off his ear.","20":"Now when it was evening, Yeshua was reclining at the table with the Twelve.","59":"Now the ruling kohanim and all the Sanhedrin kept trying to get false testimony against Yeshua so they could put Him to death.","69":"Meanwhile, Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came over to him and said, “You also were with Yeshua of the Galilee.”","54":"How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?”","66":"What’s your verdict?”  “Guilty,” they answered. “He deserves death!”","57":"Now those who had seized Yeshua led Him away to Caiaphas, the kohen gadol, where the Torah scholars and elders had gathered.","43":"And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.","35":"“Even if I must die with You,” Peter says to Him, “I’ll never deny You!” And so said all the disciples.","41":"Keep watching and praying, so that you won’t enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”","5":"“But not during the festival,” they were saying, “so there won’t be a riot among the people.”","34":"Yeshua said to him, “Truly, I tell you, this very night, before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.”","6":"Now while Yeshua was in Bethany at the house of Simon ha-Metzora,","53":"Or do you suppose that I cannot call on My Father, and at once He will place at My side twelve legions  of angels?","2":"“You know that Passover comes in two days, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be executed.”","44":"So He left them again and prayed a third time, saying the same words once more.","72":"Again he denied it with an oath: “I don’t know the Man!”","11":"You always have the poor with you,  but you won’t always have Me.","70":"But he denied it before everyone, saying, “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”","68":"“Prophesy to us, you Messiah! Which one hit You?”","1":"Now it happened that when Yeshua had finished all these words, He said to His disciples,","58":"Peter was following Him from a distance as far as the courtyard of the kohen gadol. And after going inside, he was sitting with the guards, to see the outcome.","55":"At that hour Yeshua said to the crowds, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, to capture Me as you would a revolutionary?  Every day I sat teaching in the Temple, and you didn’t seize Me.","33":"But Peter replied to Him, “Though all fall away because of You, I’ll never fall away.”","67":"Then they spat in His face and pounded Him with their fists.  Others slapped Him and demanded,","27":"And He took a cup; and after giving thanks, He gave to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you;","16":"From then on, Judah began looking for a chance to hand Him over.","64":"“As you have said,” replied Yeshua. “Besides that, I tell you, soon after you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”","24":"The Son of Man indeed goes, just as it is written about Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed!  It would have been better for that man if he had not been born!”","19":"The disciples did as Yeshua had ordered them, and they prepared the Passover.","29":"But I say to you, I will never drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in My Father’s kingdom.”","61":"and said, “This fellow said, ‘I’m able to destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days!’”","9":"It could have been sold for a lot, and the money given to the poor!”","74":"Then he began to curse  and to swear an oath: “I do not know the Man!” Right then, a rooster crowed.","37":"And He took along Peter and Zebedee’s two sons, and He began to be sorrowful and troubled.","7":"a woman came up to Him with an alabaster jar of very expensive oil. And she poured it on His head as He was reclining at the table.","52":"Then Yeshua said to him, “Put your sword back in its place! For all who take up the sword shall perish by the sword.","39":"Going a little farther, He fell face down and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me! Yet not as I will, but as You will.”","48":"Now His betrayer had given them a sign, saying, ‘The One I kiss, He’s the One — seize Him!’","21":"As they were eating, He said, “Amen, I tell you, one of you will betray Me.”","56":"But all this has happened so that the writings of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples fled, abandoning Him.","46":"Get up, let’s go! Look, My betrayer is near.”","75":"Then Peter reminded himself of the word Yeshua had said: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.” And he went away and wept bitterly.","32":"But after I am raised up, I will go before you to the Galilee.”","31":"Then Yeshua said to them, “This night you will all fall away because of Me; for it is written, ‘I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’","15":"and said, “What are you willing to give me if I hand Him over to you?” And they weighed out thirty shekels  of silver for him.","25":"And Judah, the one betraying Him, replied, “I’m not the one, am I, Rabbi?” Yeshua said to him, “You’ve said it yourself.”","18":"He said, “Go into the city to a certain man, and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near; at your house I am to keep the Passover with My disciples.”’”","42":"Again for a second time He went away and prayed, saying, “My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, let Your will be done.”"},"14":{"11":"His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.","3":"For Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip,","20":"They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of broken pieces left over.","12":"John’s disciples came forth and took the body and buried it. Then they went and reported to Yeshua.","10":"And he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.","17":"“We have nothing here except five loaves and two fish,” they said to Him.","13":"Now when Yeshua heard this, He went away from there privately by boat to an isolated place. But when the crowds heard, they followed Him on foot from the towns.","27":"But immediately, Yeshua spoke to them, saying, “Take courage! I am. Don’t be afraid.”","30":"But seeing the wind, he became terrified. And beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, “Master, save me!”","18":"“Bring them here to Me,” He said.","36":"and kept begging Him that they might just touch the tzitzit of His garment — and all who touched it were cured.","29":"And He said, “Come!” And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water to go to Yeshua.","23":"After He had sent the crowds away, He went up on the hillside by Himself to pray. And when evening came, He was there alone.","19":"Ordering the crowd to recline on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish; and looking up to heaven, He offered the bracha. After breaking the loaves, He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.","1":"At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Yeshua.","5":"Although Herod wanted to kill John, he feared the crowd because they considered John a prophet.","4":"because John had been telling him, “It is not permitted for you to have her.”","8":"Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Immerser, here on a platter!”","26":"But when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, “It’s a ghost!” And they cried out with fear.","14":"As Yeshua came ashore, He saw a large crowd and felt compassion for them and healed their sick.","22":"Right away, Yeshua made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away.","28":"Answering, Peter said to Him, “Master, if it’s You, command me to come to You on the water.”","25":"Now in the fourth watch  of the night, Yeshua came to them, walking on the sea.","9":"The king became sorrowful; but because of his oaths and those reclining with him, he commanded it to be given.","33":"And those in the boat worshiped Him, saying, “You really are Ben-Elohim!”","15":"When it became evening, the disciples came to Him, saying, “This place is isolated, and the hour is already late. Send the crowds away so they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves.”","34":"After they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.","21":"Now those eating were about five thousand men, besides women and children.","24":"But the boat was already a long way  from land, tossed around by the waves, for the wind was against it.","16":"But Yeshua said to them, “They don’t need to leave — you give them something to eat.”","35":"And when the men of that place recognized Yeshua, they sent word into all the surrounding region. And they brought to Him all those who were in bad shape","32":"When they got into the boat, the wind ceased.","7":"so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.","2":"He said to his servants, “This is John the Immerser — he has risen from the dead! Because of this, these powers are at work in Him.”","6":"But when Herod’s birthday celebration came, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod,","31":"Immediately Yeshua reached out His hand and grabbed him. And He said to him, “O you of little faith, why did you doubt?”"},"22":{"11":"“But when the king came in to look over the guests, he saw a man there who wasn’t dressed in wedding clothes.","41":"Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Yeshua asked them a question,","45":"If David then calls Him ‘Lord,’ how is He his son?”","42":"saying, “What do you think about the Messiah? Whose Son is He?”  “David’s,” they say to Him.","3":"He sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they wouldn’t come.","20":"And He said to them, “Whose image is this? And whose inscription?”","12":"‘Friend,’ he said to him, ‘how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ But the man was silent.","10":"And those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all they found, both bad and good; and the wedding was filled with guests.","17":"Tell us therefore, what do You think? Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”","44":"For he says, ‘ADONAI said to my Lord, “Sit at My right hand, until I put Your enemies under Your feet.”’","40":"The entire Torah and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”","13":"Then the king said to his servants, ‘Tie him up hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’","27":"Last of all, the woman died.","30":"For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.","18":"But Yeshua, knowing their wickedness, said, “Why are you testing Me, you hypocrites?","36":"“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Torah?”","29":"But answering, Yeshua said to them, “You’ve gone astray, because you don’t understand the Scriptures or the power of God.","23":"On that day, Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) came to Yeshua and questioned Him, saying,","19":"Show Me the tax money.” So they brought Him a denarius.","1":"Yeshua answered and spoke to them again in parables, saying,","5":"“But paying no attention, they went away, one to his own farm, another to his business.","4":"Again he sent out other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who were invited, “Look, I’ve prepared my meal. My oxen and fattened cattle are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast!”’","8":"“Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.","26":"In the same way also the second, and the third, down to the seventh.","39":"And the second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’","14":"For many are called, but few are chosen.”","37":"And He said to him, “‘You shall love ADONAI your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’","22":"And hearing this, they were amazed. So they left Him and went away.","28":"So in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had married her.”","25":"Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died; and having no offspring, left his wife to his brother.","9":"So go into the highways and byways, and invite everyone you find to the wedding feast.’","33":"When the crowds heard this, they were astounded at His teaching.","15":"Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might trap Him with a word.","34":"But the Pharisees, when they heard that Yeshua had silenced the Sadducees, gathered together in one place.","21":"“Caesar’s,” they said to Him. Then He said to them, “Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”","24":"“Teacher, Moses said, ‘If someone dies having no children, his brother as next of kin shall marry his widow and father children for his brother.’","46":"No one was able to answer Him a word. Nor did anyone dare from that day on to question Him any longer.","16":"And they sent to Him some of their disciples, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that You are honest and teach the way of God in truth. And what others think doesn’t concern You, for You do not look at men’s appearance.","35":"And testing Him, one of them, a lawyer, asked,","32":"‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living!”","7":"Now the king became furious! Sending his troops, he destroyed those murderers and set fire to their city.","43":"“Then how is it,” He says to them, “that David by the Ruach calls him ‘Lord’?","2":"“The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who made a wedding feast for his son.","38":"This is the first and greatest commandment.","6":"And the rest grabbed his servants, humiliated them, and killed them.","31":"But concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven’t you read what was spoken to you by God, saying,"},"28":{"16":"Now the eleven disciples went to the Galilee, to the mountain Yeshua had designated.","3":"His appearance was like lightning,  and his clothing as white as snow.","5":"But the angel answered and said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know you are looking for Yeshua who was crucified.","18":"And Yeshua came up to them and spoke to them, saying, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.","12":"And when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of silver to the soldiers,","10":"“Don’t be afraid,” Yeshua said to them. “Go tell My brothers to head for the Galilee, and there they will see Me.”","2":"And suddenly there was a great earthquake, for an angel of ADONAI descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it.","8":"They quickly left the tomb, with fear yet with great joy, and ran to bring news to His disciples.","17":"When they saw Him, they worshiped; but some wavered.","11":"Now while they were going, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the ruling kohanim all that had happened.","1":"Now after Shabbat, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Miriam of Magdala and the other Miriam came to look at the tomb.","9":"And behold, Yeshua met them. “Shalom!” He said. They drew near, grasped his feet, and worshiped Him.","14":"And if this is heard by the governor, we’ll appease him and keep you out of trouble.”","7":"Go quickly now and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead. And behold, He’s going before you to the Galilee. There you will see Him. See, I have told you!”","15":"So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story was spread among the Judeans to this day.","20":"teaching them to observe all I have commanded you. And remember! I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”","6":"He is not here; for He is risen, just as He said. Come, see the place where He  was lying.","4":"And those keeping watch were shaken for fear of him and became like dead men.","19":"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, immersing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Ruach ha-Kodesh,","13":"saying, “Tell them, ‘His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we were sleeping.’"},"25":{"11":"Now later, the other virgins came, saying, ‘Sir, Sir, open up for us!’","41":"Then He will also say to those on the left, ‘Go away from Me, you cursed ones, into the everlasting fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels.","45":"Then He will answer them, saying, ‘Amen, I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for Me.’","42":"For I was hungry and you gave Me nothing to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink;","3":"For when the foolish ones took their lamps, they took no oil with them.","20":"The one who had received the five talents came up and brought another five talents, saying, ‘Master, you handed me five talents. Look, I’ve gained five more.’","12":"“But he replied, ‘Amen, I tell you, I do not know you.’","10":"“But while they were going off to buy, the bridegroom came. And those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut.","17":"In the same way, the one with two gained two more.","44":"“Then they too will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not care for You?’","40":"“And answering, the King will say to them, ‘Amen, I tell you, whatever you did to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.’","13":"Therefore stay alert, for you know neither the day nor the hour.”","27":"Then you should have brought my money to the brokers, and when I came I would have received it back with interest.","30":"Throw the worthless servant out, into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’”","18":"But the one who received one went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money.","36":"I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.’","29":"For to the one who has, more shall be given, and he shall have an abundance. But from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away.","23":"His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You were faithful with a little, so I’ll put you in charge of much. Enter into your master’s joy!’","19":"“Now after a long time, the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them.","1":"“Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.","5":"“Now while the bridegroom was taking a long time, they all got drowsy and started falling asleep.","4":"But the wise ones took oil in jars along with their lamps.","8":"Now the foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, since our lamps are going out.’","26":"“But his master responded, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! You knew that I reap where I didn’t sow and gather where I scattered no seed?","39":"When did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?’","14":"“For it is like a man about to go on a journey. He called his own servants and handed over his possessions to them.","37":"“Then the righteous will answer Him, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You? Or thirsty and give You something to drink?","22":"“The one who had received the two talents also came up and said, ‘Master, you handed me two talents. Look, I’ve gained two more.’","28":"Therefore take the talent away from him, and give it to the one who has the ten talents.","25":"So I was afraid, and I went off and hid your talent in the ground.

Instead, go to those who sell, and buy some for yourselves.’","33":"And He will put the sheep on His right, but the goats on His left.","15":"To one he gave five talents,  to another two, and to another one, each according to his own ability. Then he went on his journey.","34":"Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.","21":"His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant!
