For His camp is very vast — for mighty is it that carries out His word. For great is the day of ADONAI —  very terrifying! Who can endure it?","3":"A fire devours before them and behind them flame blazes up. Like the Garden of Eden is the land before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness. Nothing at all ever escapes them.","20":"“But I will remove the northern invader far from you — yes, I will banish him to a dry and desolate land — his vanguard into the Eastern Sea and his rearguard into the Western Sea. His odor will go up — Yes, his stench will rise.” For He  has done great things!","12":"“Yet even now” — it is a declaration of ADONAI — “turn to Me with all your heart, with fasting, weeping and lamenting.”","10":"Before them land quakes, heaven trembles, sun and moon become dark, stars withdraw their brightness.","17":"Between the porch and the altar let the kohanim, ministers of ADONAI, weep, and let them say: “Have pity, ADONAI, on Your people. Don’t make Your heritage a scorn, a byword among the nations. Why should the peoples say, ‘Where is their God?’”","13":"Rend your heart, not your garments, and turn to ADONAI, your God. For He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abundant in mercy, and relenting about the calamity due.","27":"You will know that I am within Israel. Yes, I am ADONAI your God — there is no other — Never again will My people be shamed.”","18":"ADONAI will be zealous for His land, and have compassion on His people.","23":"So be glad, children of Zion, and rejoice in ADONAI, your God. For He gives you the early rain  for prosperity, Yes, He will bring down rain for you, the early and latter rain as before.","19":"ADONAI will answer and say to His people: “Behold, I will send you the grain, the new wine, and the fresh oil, and you will be satisfied with it. I will no longer make you a mockery among the nations.","1":"Blow the shofar in Zion! Sound an alarm on My holy mountain! Let all living in the land tremble — for the day of ADONAI is coming — surely it is near!","5":"Like the clatter of chariots,  they leap on the tops of mountains, like crackling flame of fire devouring stubble, like a mighty horde in battle array.","4":"Their appearance is like the appearance of horses — they gallop like war horses.","8":"One does not crowd another. Each one marches on his own highway. They plunge through the weapons, never breaking off.","26":"“You will surely eat and be satisfied, and praise the Name of ADONAI your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. Never again will My people be shamed","14":"Who knows? He may turn and relent, and may leave a blessing behind Him — so there may be a grain offering and a drink offering for ADONAI, your God.","22":"Do not be afraid, beasts of the field, for the desert pastures have sprouted, for the tree bears its fruit. Fig tree and vine yield their strength.","25":"“I shall restore to you the years that the locust, the swarming locust, the canker-worm and the caterpillar have eaten — My great army that I sent among you.”","9":"They rush on the city, they run on the wall, they climb up into the houses, coming through the windows like a thief.","15":"Blow the shofar in Zion! Sanctify a fast; proclaim an assembly.","21":"Do not fear, O land. Be glad! Rejoice! For ADONAI has done great things.","24":"The threshing floors will be full of grain and the vats will overflow with new wine and fresh oil.","16":"Gather the people; sanctify the congregation; assemble the elders; gather the children, even those nursing at breasts. Let the bridegroom come out from his bedroom and the bride from her chamber.","7":"They run like mighty men. They climb a wall like men of war. They each march in line, never deviating from their ways.","2":"A day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as blackness spreads over the mountains. A great and mighty people — from antiquity there was never anything like it, nor after it ever again from generation to generation.","6":"Before them peoples are in anguish. All faces become ashen gray."},"4":{"16":"ADONAI will roar from Zion and give His voice from Jerusalem. Heaven and earth will shudder, Shalom in Zion  but ADONAI will be a refuge for His people, and a safe place for the children of Israel.","3":"They cast lots for My people, traded a boy for a prostitute, and sold a girl for wine, which they drank.”","5":"For you took My silver and My gold, and you carried My valuable treasures into your temples.","21":"I will acquit their bloodguilt that I had not acquitted,  for ADONAI dwells in Zion.","18":"It will be in that day, the mountains will drip sweet wine, the hills will flow with milk, and all the wadis of Judah will flow with water.  A spring will flow out from the House of ADONAI and water the valley of Shittim.","12":"“Let the nations rouse themselves and go up to the valley of Jehoshaphat. For there will I sit to judge all the surrounding nations.”","10":"Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning knives into spears. Let the weak say, “I am strong.”","2":"I will gather all nations and bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat. I will plead  with them there on behalf of My people, even My inheritance, Israel, whom they scattered among the nations and they divided up My land.","8":"I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they will sell them to the men of Sheba , to a nation far off — for ADONAI has spoken.”","17":"So you will know that I am ADONAI, your God, dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain. Then will Jerusalem be holy, and foreigners will cross through her no more.","11":"Rouse yourselves and come, all nations around, and gather there. ADONAI, bring Your mighty ones down!","1":"“For behold, in those days and at that time, when I restore Judah and Jerusalem from exile,","9":"Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare for war. Stir up the mighty men. Let the warriors advance and attack.","14":"Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision! For the day of ADONAI is near in the valley of decision.","7":"“Behold, I am rousing them from the place where you sold them, and I will return your retribution on your own head.","15":"The sun and the moon become dark, the stars withdraw their brightness.","20":"But Judah will be inhabited forever — Jerusalem from generation to generation.","6":"“The children of Judah and of Jerusalem you sold to the Greeks in order to remove them far from their own territory.","4":"“Moreover, what are you to Me, Tyre and Sidon  and all regions of Philistia? Did you render retribution for Me? Even if you were rendering retribution for Me, swiftly, speedily, will I return your retribution back on your own head.","19":"Egypt will become a desolation and Edom a desert wasteland, because of the violence against the children of Judah, because they shed innocent blood in their land.","13":"Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, tread, for the winepress is full — the vats overflow — for their wickedness is great!"},"1":{"16":"Is food not cut off before our eyes — joy and gladness from God’s House?","3":"Tell your children about it — your children to their children, their children to another generation.","5":"Awake, drunkards, and weep! Wail, all you drinkers of wine — on account of sweet wine, for it is denied to your mouth!","18":"How the animals groan! The herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture. The flocks of sheep also suffer.","12":"The vine withered, the fig tree wilted. Pomegranate, palm and apple tree — all trees of the field — are withered, for joy has withered away from the children of men.","10":"The field is ruined, the land grieves, for the grain has been devastated, new wine is dried up, oil languishes.","2":"Hear this, elders! Give ear, all inhabitants of the land. Has this ever happened in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?","8":"Wail like a virgin dressed in sackcloth for the husband of her youth!","17":"Seed has shriveled under the dirt clod. Storehouses are desolate, granaries are torn down, for the grain has withered.","11":"Be ashamed, O ploughmen; wail, O vinedressers, over wheat and over barley, for the harvest of the field is lost.","1":"The word of ADONAI that came to Joel the son of Pethuel:","9":"Grain offering and drink offering are cut off from the House of ADONAI. Kohanim — ministers of ADONAI — mourn.","14":"Consecrate a fast. Proclaim a solemn assembly. Gather elders and all living in the land to the House of ADONAI your God, and cry to ADONAI.","7":"He has turned my vine to waste and my fig tree to splinters. He has stripped off all the bark and flung it down — its branches are left white.","15":"Ah, the day! The day of ADONAI is near! As havoc from Shaddai it will come.","20":"Also beasts of the field pant toward You. For the water of wadis are dried up, and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.","6":"For a nation has invaded my land. Vast — yes, without number! Its teeth are lion’s teeth, with jaw-teeth of a lioness.","4":"What the locust left, the swarming locust has eaten, and what the swarming locust left, the canker-worm has eaten, and what the canker-worm left, the caterpillar has eaten.","19":"To You, ADONAI, I cry! For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and flame has set ablaze all the trees of the field.","13":"Gird yourselves and weep, kohanim! Howl, ministers of the altar! Come, lie in sackcloth all night, ministers of my God. For grain and drink offering are withheld from the House of your God."},"3":{"2":"“Also on the male and the female servants will I pour out My spirit in those days.","4":"The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before the great and awesome day of ADONAI comes.","5":"Then all who call on ADONAI’s Name  will escape, for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be rescue, as ADONAI has said, among the survivors whom ADONAI is calling.”","1":"“So it will be afterward,  I will pour out My Ruach on all flesh:  your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions.","3":"I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth — blood, fire and pillars of smoke."}}}
