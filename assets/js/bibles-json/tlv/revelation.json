If anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way.","18":"The nations were enraged, but Your wrath has come  and the time for the dead to be judged — to reward Your servants, the prophets and kedoshim, and those who fear Your name, the small and the great, and to destroy the destroyers of the earth.”","12":"Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here!” And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies watched them.","10":"Those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them.

The third woe is coming soon.","7":"When they have finished their testimony, the beast that rises from the abyss will make war on them, and overcome them and kill them.","15":"Then the seventh angel trumpeted, and there were loud voices in heaven saying, “The kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Anointed One. And He shall reign forever and ever!”","6":"These two have the power to shut the heavens, so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying.

These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been redeemed from among mankind as firstfruits for God and the Lamb.","19":"So the angel swung his sickle over the earth and gathered the clusters from the vineyard of the earth and threw them into the great winepress of the wrath of God.","13":"Then I heard a voice from heaven saying,  “Write: How fortunate are the dead — those who die in the Lord from now on!” “Yes,” says the Ruach, “that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them.”"},"7":{"16":"They shall never again go hungry, nor thirst anymore; the sun shall not beat down on them, nor any scorching heat.","3":"saying, “Do no harm to the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.”","5":"12,000 from the tribe of Judah; 12,000 from the tribe of Reuben; 12,000 from the tribe of Gad;","12":"saying, “Amen, blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might belong to our God forever and ever.

Just and true are Your ways, O King of the nations!","2":"And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had overcome the beast and his image  and the number of his name standing by the sea of glass, holding the harps of God.","1":"Then I saw another great and wonderful sign in heaven: seven angels who have seven plagues — the last ones, for with them God’s wrath is finished.","4":"Who shall not fear and glorify Your name, O Lord?
