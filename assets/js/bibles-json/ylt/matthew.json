field.\u0027","29":"\u0027And he said, No, lest -- gathering up the darnel -- ye root up with it the wheat,","23":"\u0027And that sown on the good ground: this is he who is hearing the word, and is

evil one doth come, and doth catch that which hath been sown in his heart; this is that sown by the way.","1":"And in that day Jesus, having gone forth from the house, was sitting by the sea,","47":"\u0027Again, the reign of the heavens is like to a net that was cast into the sea, and did gather together of every kind,","5":"and others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth, and immediately they sprang forth, through not having depth of earth,","54":"and having come to his own country, he was teaching them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and

out of the midst of the righteous,","4":"and in his sowing, some indeed fell by the way, and the fowls did come and devour them,","8":"and others fell upon the good ground, and were giving fruit, some indeed a hundredfold, and some sixty, and some thirty.","58":"and he did not there many mighty works, because of their unbelief.","26":"and when the herb sprang up, and yielded fruit, then appeared also the darnel.","39":"and the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest is a full end of the age, and the reapers are messengers.","14":"and fulfilled on them is the prophecy of Isaiah, that saith, With hearing ye shall hear, and ye shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see, and ye shall not perceive,","37":"And he answering said to them, \u0027He who is sowing the good seed is the Son of Man,","22":"\u0027And that sown toward the thorns, this is he who is hearing the word, and the anxiety of this age, and the deceitfulness of the riches, do choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.","28":"And he saith to them, A man, an enemy, did this; and the servants said to him, Wilt thou, then, [that] having gone away we may gather it up?","25":"and, while men are sleeping, his enemy came and sowed darnel in the midst of the wheat, and went away,","9":"He who is having ears to hear -- let him hear.\u0027","33":"Another simile spake he to them: \u0027The reign of the heavens
