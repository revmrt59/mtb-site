<p>John’s letter illustrates what happens when a healthy culture does not exist – division, self-exaltation, and lack of empowerment.</p>
<p>Because of the unhealthy leadership of Diotrephes we see all these things in the church.</p>
<ul>
<li><div class="list-paragraph">
<p>An unwillingness to EMPOWER people. Instead because of pride and the desire for preeminence, Diotrephes used his position to keep his, instead of seeking to ELEVATE and EMPOWER others.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div class="list-paragraph">
<p>A lack of UNITY in the church as Diotrephes refused to choose submission to Holy Spirit and one another over his personal preferences, giftings, and anointings. Unity is only possible through a willingness to yield ourselves.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>We see the Apostle John note the importance of HEALTH and how it spreads from the top down and the inside out as he desires inner soul prosperity leading to external well-being.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Apostle understood the value or REAL TALK as he made it clear that he would not address certain things via text or email, and instead address certain things when he could do so in person.</p>
