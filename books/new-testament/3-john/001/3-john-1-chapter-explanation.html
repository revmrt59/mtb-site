<div class="MTB-Read">
<p>3 John 1:1</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p>The Elder, To the beloved (G0027) Gaius, whom I love in truth: (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This letter opens in a very personal way.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>John starts by calling himself <span data-custom-style="Strong">“</span><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">the elder.”</span> He is not trying to impress anyone with a title. He is writing as a spiritual father, someone with maturity, authority, and care for God—s people. This already tells us the letter is relational, not formal or distant.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>He is writing <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">to Gaius</span>, a real believer and a real friend. This is not a general church letter. It is one person writing to another person.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>John says he <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">loves Gaius “in truth.”</span> That matters. He is not just saying, “I like you” or “we get along.” His love is grounded in God—s truth. In other words, their relationship is shaped by their shared faith in Christ and by walking in what is right. This is love that is sincere, honest, and spiritually grounded.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>So right from the start, this verse teaches us something important:<br />
Christian leadership is personal, Christian love is rooted in truth, and faith is meant to be lived out in real relationships.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Dwell">
<p>Dwelling</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Dwell">
<p>Whom I love in truth. Does this mean whom I truly love?</p>
</div>
<p><span data-custom-style="MTB Read Char">3 John 1:2 Beloved (G0027), I pray that you may prosper (G2137) in all things and be in health (G5198), just as your soul prospers. (NKJV)</span><br />
<br />
John begins this verse with <span data-custom-style="Strong">“Beloved.”</span> That word matters. He is not correcting Gaius. He is not warning him. He is speaking to someone he genuinely cares about. Everything that follows comes from affection, not authority.</p>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>John then says he <span data-custom-style="Strong">prays</span> for Gaius. This tells us something about godly leadership and friendship: John doesn—t just think well of Gaius, he brings him before God. Prayer is how John supports him.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>What does John pray for?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>First, that Gaius <span data-custom-style="Strong">would prosper in all things.</span> This is not about greed or excess. It simply means John wants things to go well for him in life. He wants his work, responsibilities, and daily affairs to be healthy and fruitful.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Second, that he <span data-custom-style="Strong">would be in health.</span> John cares about Gaius as a whole person. Faith is not disconnected from real life. Physical well-being matters to God and to God—s people.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>But then John adds something very important:<br />
<span data-custom-style="Strong">“just as your soul prospers.”</span></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>This is the key to the verse.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>John is saying, “I hope your outer life matches your inner life.” Gaius is already doing well spiritually. His faith is strong. His walk with God is healthy. John—s prayer is that his physical life and circumstances would reflect that same spiritual health.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>So this verse teaches us balance. God cares about the soul first, but He also cares about the rest of life. True prosperity starts on the inside and works its way outward.</p>
</div>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><mark>3 John 1:3 For I rejoiced greatly when brethren came and testified of the truth that is in you, just as you walk in the truth. (NKJV)</mark></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>John now explains <span data-custom-style="Strong">why</span> he is confident that Gaius—s soul is doing well.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>He says he <span data-custom-style="Strong">rejoiced greatly</span> when other believers came and reported about Gaius. That tells us something important: Gaius—s faith was visible. People noticed it. His life left an impression on others.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>What did they report?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>They testified to <span data-custom-style="Strong">the truth that is in him</span>. This does not mean Gaius just knew correct doctrine. It means God—s truth had taken root in his life. Truth lived inside him, shaped his choices, and showed up in how he treated people.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Then John adds this phrase: <span data-custom-style="Strong">“just as you walk in the truth.”</span></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>This is huge.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Gaius didn—t just believe the truth. He <span data-custom-style="Strong">walked</span> in it. His daily life matched what he believed. His behavior lined up with his confession. Faith was not theoretical for him; it was practical.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>So verse 3 teaches us a simple but powerful lesson:<br />
Spiritual health is proven by how someone lives, not just by what they say they believe.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>John rejoices because Gaius—s faith is steady, visible, and consistent. The truth is not just in his head; it is guiding his steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:4</strong> I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. (NKJV)</mark></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>This is one of the most personal statements John ever makes, and it really shows his heart as a spiritual father.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>He says, <span data-custom-style="Strong">“I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.”</span> That is not exaggeration. John means it.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>John has lived a long life. He has seen churches grow, churches struggle, leaders rise, and leaders fall. He has experienced persecution, conflict, and loss. Out of all of that, he tells us what brings him the <span data-custom-style="Strong">greatest joy</span>.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>It is not success.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>It is not numbers.<br />
It is not reputation.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>It is seeing believers <span data-custom-style="Strong">continue</span> to walk in truth.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>When John calls them <span data-custom-style="Strong">“my children,”</span> he is speaking as a spiritual father. These are people he has poured into, taught, prayed for, and cared about. Their faith matters deeply to him.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>And notice the word <span data-custom-style="Strong">“walk.”</span> This is not about a single good moment or one strong decision. It is about a steady, ongoing way of life. John—s joy comes from seeing people stay faithful over time.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>This verse teaches us something foundational:<br />
The true measure of spiritual success is not how someone starts, but how they walk.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>For John, nothing is more rewarding than knowing the truth he preached is now being lived out in the lives of others.</p>
</div>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:5</strong> Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do for the brethren and for strangers, (NKJV)</mark></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>John begins again with the word <span data-custom-style="Strong">“Beloved.”</span> This reminds us that what he is about to say comes from encouragement, not criticism.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>He tells Gaius that he is acting <span data-custom-style="Strong">faithfully</span> in what he does. That word means dependable, trustworthy, and consistent. Gaius is not just sincere; he is reliable in how he lives out his faith.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>What exactly is Gaius doing?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>John points to how he treats <span data-custom-style="Strong">the brethren and strangers</span>. In other words, Gaius shows love not only to believers he knows well, but also to believers he has never met before. These “strangers” are traveling Christians, likely people serving God who depended on the hospitality of others.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>This tells us something important about real faith:<br />
It shows up in how we treat people when there is no personal benefit.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Gaius did not help others because it was convenient or because he would get something back. He did it because it was right. He lived out the truth he believed by opening his life to others.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>So verse 5 teaches us that faithfulness is proven through action. Walking in truth always leads to loving service.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Gaius didn—t just believe correctly; he lived generously.</p>
</div>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:6</strong> who have borne witness of your love before the church. If you send them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God, you will do well, (NKJV)</mark></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>John now shows the <span data-custom-style="Strong">result</span> of Gaius—s faithfulness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>He says these believers <span data-custom-style="Strong">have borne witness of your love before the church</span>. That means Gaius—s actions didn—t stay private. People talked about them. His love was noticeable and worth reporting.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>This is important:<br />
Gaius wasn—t trying to be seen, but his love was seen.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>John then encourages him to <span data-custom-style="Strong">send them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God</span>. In other words, “Keep doing what you—re doing, and do it in a way that reflects God—s character.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>This isn—t just about being polite or generous. John raises the standard very high. Helping God—s servants should reflect how <span data-custom-style="Strong">God Himself</span> would treat them. That means care, honor, and generosity.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>So verse 6 teaches us something practical and foundational:<br />
How we treat God—s people reflects what we believe about God.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Gaius understood that serving others was not just kindness, it was worship. His hospitality became a testimony to the whole church.</p>
</div>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:7</strong> because they went forth for His name—s sake, taking nothing from the Gentiles. (NKJV)</mark></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Here John explains <span data-custom-style="Strong">why</span> supporting these traveling believers matters so much.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>He says they went out <span data-custom-style="Strong">“for the sake of the Name.”</span> That phrase is powerful. John doesn—t even need to say the name of Jesus. Everyone knows who he means. These people left their homes, comfort, and security to serve Christ and make Him known.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>They were not chasing attention or profit. They were motivated by loyalty to Jesus.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>John then adds that they <span data-custom-style="Strong">took nothing from the Gentiles</span>. In simple terms, they didn—t ask unbelievers to support God—s work. They didn—t want the message of Christ mixed with money, pressure, or obligation from those who didn—t yet believe.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>This is where Gaius comes in.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Because these workers depended on fellow believers for support, hospitality was not optional. It was essential. Without people like Gaius, their work could not continue.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>So verse 7 teaches us this:<br />
God often chooses to advance His work through the faithfulness of ordinary believers.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Gaius may not have been traveling or preaching, but by supporting those who did, he became a partner in the work of the gospel.</p>
</div>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:8</strong> We therefore ought to receive such, that we may become fellow workers for the truth. (NKJV)</mark></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>John now makes the principle clear.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>He says <span data-custom-style="Strong">“we therefore ought to receive such”</span>. This is not a suggestion. It is a responsibility. Believers have a role to play in supporting those who serve Christ.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Why?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>So that <span data-custom-style="Strong">we may become fellow workers for the truth</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>This is the heart of the verse.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>John is teaching that not everyone serves God in the same way, but everyone can share in the work. Some go. Some teach. Some travel. Others support, host, give, and encourage. All of it counts.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Gaius may not have been preaching in new places, but through his generosity and hospitality, he became a <span data-custom-style="Strong">partner</span> in the spread of the truth. God sees his support as real participation, not second-class service.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>So verse 8 teaches us a foundational truth:<br />
You don—t have to be visible to be vital in God—s work.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Supporting the truth is the same as working for the truth.</p>
</div>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:9</strong> I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, does not receive us. (NKJV)</mark></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Up to this point, John has been encouraging and affirming. Now he introduces a <span data-custom-style="Strong">problem</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>John says he <span data-custom-style="Strong">wrote to the church</span>, but then he mentions a man named <span data-custom-style="Strong">Diotrephes</span>. This is the first negative example in the letter, and John does not soften it.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>He says Diotrephes <span data-custom-style="Strong">“loves to have the preeminence among them.”</span> That phrase means Diotrephes wants to be first. He wants control, attention, and authority. Leadership, for him, is about position, not service.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Because of this, John says Diotrephes <span data-custom-style="Strong">does not receive us</span>. In other words, he rejects apostolic authority. He is not teachable. He decides who gets heard and who doesn—t.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>This verse teaches a hard but important lesson:<br />
Someone can be active in church life and still be driven by pride.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Diotrephes stands in sharp contrast to Gaius. Gaius opens his life to others. Diotrephes shuts people out. Gaius supports God—s work. Diotrephes protects his own status.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>John includes this verse to show that walking in truth is not just about belief, it—s about humility.</p>
</div>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:10</strong> Therefore, if I come, I will call to mind his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words. And not content with that, he himself does not receive the brethren, and forbids those who wish to, putting them out of the church. (NKJV)</mark></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Here John explains <span data-custom-style="Strong">what Diotrephes is actually doing</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>First, John says, <span data-custom-style="Strong">“If I come, I will call to mind his deeds.”</span> That tells us two things. John is aware of what—s happening, and he is not afraid to address it. Godly leadership does not ignore harmful behavior just to keep peace.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Then John lists the problems.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Diotrephes is <span data-custom-style="Strong">speaking malicious words</span>. That means he is using harmful, false, or exaggerated speech. His words are tearing people down, not building them up. This is how pride often shows itself: through speech that damages others.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>But John says that isn—t even enough for him.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Diotrephes <span data-custom-style="Strong">does not receive the brethren</span>. He refuses to welcome faithful believers. He closes the door to people God has sent.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Worse still, he <span data-custom-style="Strong">forbids those who want to receive them</span>. In other words, he controls others through fear or pressure. He doesn—t just refuse hospitality himself; he stops others from showing it.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Finally, John says he <span data-custom-style="Strong">puts them out of the church</span>. This is serious. Diotrephes is using authority to punish people for doing what is right.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>This verse teaches a sobering lesson:<br />
Pride in leadership always harms the community.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Diotrephes uses position to protect himself, not to serve others. His actions stand in total contrast to Gaius, who opened his life to serve the truth.</p>
</div>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:11</strong> Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He who does good is of God, but he who does evil has not seen God. (NKJV)</mark></p>
</div>
<p>John now speaks <span data-custom-style="Strong">directly and personally</span> to Gaius.</p>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>He begins again with <span data-custom-style="Strong">“Beloved.”</span> Even when addressing serious issues, John leads with care. This is instruction rooted in relationship.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Then he gives a clear command:<br />
<span data-custom-style="Strong">“Do not imitate what is evil, but what is good.”</span></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>John is saying, “You have choices. You are watching two different examples play out in real life.” On one side is Diotrephes, driven by pride and control. On the other side is Gaius, marked by humility, generosity, and faithfulness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>John makes the line very clear.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">“He who does good is of God.”</span><br />
That does not mean earning salvation. It means that a life yielded by God will naturally produce goodness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">“He who does evil has not seen God.”</span><br />
This is strong language. John is not saying Diotrephes has never heard about God. He is saying his behavior shows a lack of true understanding of who God is. You cannot truly see or know who God is and consistently act in ways that oppose His character.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>So verse 11 teaches a foundational truth:<br />
Belief and behavior are connected. Walking in truth will show itself in how we treat people.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>John is cautioning us, “be careful who we choose to copy and follow.”</p>
</div>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:12</strong> Demetrius has a good testimony from all, and from the truth itself. And we also bear witness, and you know that our testimony is true. (NKJV)</mark></p>
</div>
<p>After warning about Diotrephes, John now points to a <span data-custom-style="Strong">healthy example</span>.</p>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>He introduces a man named <span data-custom-style="Strong">Demetrius</span> and says that he <span data-custom-style="Strong">has a good testimony from all</span>. That means people consistently speak well of him. His character is not questionable or mixed. Over time, his life has proven trustworthy.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>But John doesn—t stop there.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>He says Demetrius also has a good testimony <span data-custom-style="Strong">from the truth itself</span>. In other words, his life lines up with God—s truth. If you compare how he lives with what Scripture teaches, they match.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Then John adds, <span data-custom-style="Strong">“and we also bear witness.”</span> John personally vouches for him. This is strong affirmation. John is saying, “I know this man, and I stand behind him.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Finally, John says, <span data-custom-style="Strong">“and you know that our testimony is true.”</span> John appeals to the trust that already exists between him and Gaius. This isn—t manipulation. It—s relational credibility.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Demetrius doesn—t need to defend himself. His life speaks for him. He stands in contrast to Diotrephes, whose actions exposed his heart.</p>
</div>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:13-14</strong> 3John 13 I had many things to write, but I do not wish to write to you with pen and ink; 3John 14 but I hope to see you shortly, and we shall speak face to face. Peace to you. Our friends greet you. Greet the friends by name. (NKJV)</mark></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>John closes the letter the same way he began it: personally and relationally.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>He says he has <span data-custom-style="Strong">many things to write</span>, but he doesn—t want to do it with pen and ink. This tells us the relationship matters more than the information. John values presence over paperwork.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Then he says he <span data-custom-style="Strong">hopes to see Gaius shortly</span>, so they can speak <span data-custom-style="Strong">face to face</span>. This is important. Some things are better handled in person, especially encouragement, correction, and shared joy. John is not trying to manage everything from a distance.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Next, he says, <span data-custom-style="Strong">“Peace to you.”</span> This is not a casual goodbye. Peace is the settled well-being that comes from walking in truth and right relationships. After addressing conflict, pride, and faithfulness, John speaks peace over Gaius—s life.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Finally, John says, <span data-custom-style="Strong">“Our friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.”</span> This small line says a lot. Christianity is not anonymous. People matter. Names matter. Relationships matter.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>So the letter ends where it began: with truth lived out in real relationships.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>These verses quietly reinforce the foundation of the whole book:<br />
Faith is personal. Truth is relational. Leadership is about people, not control.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>3 John is very simple but also very relevant. It shows us <span data-custom-style="Strong">three lives</span>:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Gaius, who walks in truth</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Diotrephes, who loves control</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Demetrius, whose life matches the truth</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
