<h1 id="reflections-teaching-and-application-points-from-3-john">Reflections – Teaching and Application Points from 3 John</h1>
<h3 id="truth-is-not-only-believed-it-is-lived">1. Truth Is Not Only Believed, It Is Lived</h3>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>John rejoices not because Gaius believes the truth, but because he walks in it. Truth that remains only in the mind has not yet done its work. Real truth reshapes behavior, priorities, and relationships.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="strong">Reflection:</span><br />
Do my daily choices match what I say I believe?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="the-greatest-joy-of-spiritual-leaders-is-faithful-living-not-bible-knowledge">2. The Greatest Joy of Spiritual Leaders Is Faithful Living, Not Bible Knowledge</h3>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>John’s greatest joy is not that his spiritual children understand doctrine, but that they live it out. Knowledge without obedience does not bring lasting joy to mature leaders.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="strong">Reflection:</span><br />
Am I growing in obedience, or only in information?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="spiritual-prosperity-must-come-before-physical-prosperity">3. Spiritual Prosperity Must Come Before Physical Prosperity</h3>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>John prays for Gaius’s health and well-being, but only in proportion to the health of his soul. Scripture consistently places inner life above outward success.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>David Guzik said this, “Many Christians would be desperately ill if their physical health was instantly in the same state as their spiritual health.”</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="strong">Reflection:</span><br />
If my physical life instantly reflected my spiritual health, what would it look like?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="love-for-people-is-a-mark-of-christian-maturity">4. Love for People Is a Mark of Christian Maturity</h3>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>John’s repeated use of “beloved” reveals his heart. Mature believers are marked by genuine care and love for people, not impatience or superiority.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="strong">Reflection:</span><br />
Is my Christianity and Bible truth making me more loving, or merely more opinionated?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="hospitality-is-love-in-action">5. Hospitality Is Love in Action</h3>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Gaius’s faith is demonstrated through hospitality, especially toward believers he does not know personally. Love is proven not by intention, but by action, deeds and not feelings or emotion.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="strong">Reflection:</span><br />
Who has God placed in my path that I am called to receive and serve?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="faithfulness-matters-more-than-visibility-or-results">6. Faithfulness Matters More Than Visibility or Results</h3>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>John praises Gaius for simply for being and acting faithfully. God values and rewards faithfulness and reliability over show and gifting.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="strong">Reflection:</span><br />
Am I more concerned with being faithful or being noticed?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="supporting-gods-work-makes-us-partners-in-it">7. Supporting God’s Work Makes Us Partners in It</h3>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Those who support missionaries and servants of the gospel become fellow workers for the truth. Support roles are not secondary roles in God’s economy.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="strong">Reflection:</span><br />
Do I see support as real ministry, or only what happens up publically?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="pride-is-the-root-of-many-church-conflicts">8. Pride Is the Root of Many Church Conflicts</h3>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Diotrephes’s behavior flows from one desire: to be first. Pride leads to control, slander, rejection of authority, and harm to others.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="strong">Reflection:</span><br />
Where might a desire for recognition be influencing my actions? How do I respond when I am not recognized?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="pride-often-reveals-itself-through-speech">9. Pride Often Reveals Itself Through Speech</h3>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Diotrephes uses malicious and empty talk to undermine others. The words that come out of our month are often the first outward sign of a deeper heart problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="strong">Reflection:</span><br />
Do my words build up God’s work or quietly tear it down? What is coming out of my mouth? Complaining or thanksgiving? Edification or criticism?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="authority-that-refuses-accountability-is-dangerous">10. Authority That Refuses Accountability Is Dangerous</h3>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Diotrephes rejects apostolic authority and punishes those who disagree. Leadership without accountability inevitably becomes abusive. Healthy leadership functions under authority.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="strong">Reflection:</span><br />
Am I teachable and accountable, especially when corrected?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="one-unhealthy-leader-can-harm-an-entire-church">11. One Unhealthy Leader Can Harm an Entire Church</h3>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>John shows how one domineering individual can disrupt fellowship, hinder ministry, and create fear. Ignoring such behavior does not preserve peace; it destroys it.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="strong">Reflection:</span><br />
Do I avoid difficult issues for the sake of comfort, or address them for the sake of health?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="believers-must-choose-carefully-whom-they-imitate-and-follow">12. Believers Must Choose Carefully Whom They Imitate and Follow</h3>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>John explicitly warns against copying evil behavior and urges imitation of good. Who we allow access to our life, influences our life. Choose wisely whom you look to as an example.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="strong">Reflection:</span><br />
Whose example am I following, intentionally or unintentionally?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="a-good-reputation-must-be-confirmed-by-truth">13. A Good Reputation Must Be Confirmed by Truth</h3>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Demetrius has a good report from people and from the truth itself. Popular approval alone is not enough; a life must align with reality and integrity.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="strong">Reflection:</span><br />
Would the truth itself speak well of my life?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="good-works-are-evidence-not-the-basis-of-relationship-with-god">14. Good Works Are Evidence, Not the Basis, of Relationship with God</h3>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>John teaches that doing good reveals our relationship with God, while persistent evil exposes a lack of true spiritual sight.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="strong">Reflection:</span><br />
What do my consistent actions reveal about my walk with God?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="face-to-face-relationship-matters-more-than-written-communication">15. Face-to-Face Relationship Matters More Than Written Communication</h3>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>John chooses not to write everything down, valuing personal conversation. Wisdom knows the limits of written communication.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="strong">Reflection:</span><br />
Am I using written communication wisely, or hiding behind it?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="be-careful-with-words-especially-in-writing-and-media">16. Be Careful with Words, Especially in Writing and Media</h3>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>John’s restraint highlights the dangers of written words including email, texts, and social media posts. Once out there, they cannot be taken back.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="strong">Reflection:</span><br />
Do I take time to think and pause before speaking or posting, especially when emotional?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="peace-can-exist-even-in-the-presence-of-conflict">17. Peace Can Exist Even in the Presence of Conflict</h3>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>John ends with peace, even while unresolved issues remain. Peace is an inner condition rooted from a right relationship with God. True peace does not come from external circumstances or perfect harmony in all our relationships.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="strong">Reflection:</span><br />
Am I grounded in God’s peace which passes understanding, or am I dependent on having to have calm external circumstances?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="god-works-through-faithful-individuals-not-just-movements">18. God Works Through Faithful Individuals, Not Just Movements</h3>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>3 John reminds us that God advances His purposes through faithful individuals like Gaius, not just large platforms or structures.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="strong">Reflection:</span><br />
Am I being faithful where God has placed me, even if it feels unseen?</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><strong>19. Authority is Given for a Purpose</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>If you don’t know the purpose for something you will abuse it. This is why there is so much abuse of authority. People can and often do misuse authority.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="normal-web">
<p>We can mistakenly think it gives them the freedom to carry out their own desires and selfish ambitions.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div class="normal-web">
<p>We might try to use it to obtain more power, wealth, position, etc.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div class="normal-web">
<p>It can be used to try and feel in control and feed our ego, insecurity or for self-protection.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>This is what we see with Diotrephes. Diotrephes was put in a position to lead a group of believers. He misused authority to promote himself at the expense of others which caused contention, division and hurt in the church.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Authority and position never given to serve one’s self. Authority is given to serve the one who gave you the authority. In some cases this is your boss, this is your parents, this is your ministry leader. In doing so, we serve God.</p>
</div>
