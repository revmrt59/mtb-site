<p>Walking in truth is revealed through faithful love, humble leadership, and support of God’s work.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="purpose-of-this-chapter">Purpose of This Chapter</h2>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to show how truth is lived out in real church life. John affirms faithful believers who walk in truth, warns against prideful and controlling leadership, and teaches that supporting the work of the gospel makes believers partners in the truth.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="chapter-summary">Chapter Summary</h2>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>In this chapter, John writes to a man named Gaius to encourage him in his faithful walk in the truth. John affirms that Gaius’s spiritual life is healthy and that his faith is visible through love and hospitality toward fellow believers, including those he does not personally know. John explains that those who support such servants of Christ become fellow workers for the truth.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>John then contrasts this godly example with Diotrephes, a man who seeks prominence, rejects apostolic authority, and harms the church through malicious speech and exclusion. John warns believers not to imitate what is evil but to follow what is good. He commends Demetrius as a trustworthy example and closes the letter with a personal expression of peace and relationship.</p>

<h2 id="key-words-and-concepts">Key Words and Concepts</h2>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Truth: Truth in this chapter is not just correct belief, but God’s reality lived out in daily life. It is something a believer walks in, not merely mental belief or agreement.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Walk: To walk means to live in a consistent, ongoing way. It describes how faith shows up in everyday choices, behavior, and relationships.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Love: Love here is not a feeling or emotion, but practical action. It is shown through hospitality, generosity, and care for other believers.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Faithfulness: Faithfulness means being reliable and trustworthy over time. It describes steady obedience rather than dramatic moments.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Hospitality: Hospitality is the willing receiving and support of others, including strangers. In this chapter, it is a primary way truth and love are expressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Fellow Workers: Fellow workers are believers who share in God’s work, even if they serve in different ways. Supporting faithful servants makes one a partner in the gospel.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Preeminence: Preeminence is the desire to be first or most important. In this chapter, it exposes pride and unhealthy leadership.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Testimony: Testimony is the reputation a person’s life creates over time. It is the evidence others can point to when evaluating character and faith.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Good and Evil: Good refers to actions that reflect God’s character and purposes. Evil refers to behavior that harms others and opposes God’s ways, even when done inside the church.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Leadership and Authority: This chapter contrasts servant leadership with controlling leadership. True authority supports God’s work, while unhealthy authority protects position and power.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="why-this-chapter-matters">Why This Chapter Matters</h2>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>This chapter matters because it shows that faith is not measured by position, influence, or visibility, but by obedience, humility, and love. It teaches believers how to recognize healthy and unhealthy leadership and reminds the church that faithful support of God’s work is genuine participation in the gospel.</p>
