<h2 id="we-live-in-age-that-has-dismissed-the-idea-of-absolute-truth">We live in age that has dismissed the idea of absolute truth</h2>
<p><strong>John 18:38</strong> <em>Pilate said to Him, “What is truth?” ΓÇª</em>NKJV</p>
<p>We read here Pilate ask Jesus one of the most important questions one could ever ask in their life, that is “what is truth”. Unfortunately most people never really stop and think about what truth and where it comes from; yet the answer to this question determines your life, happiness, freedom, peace, mental health, and ultimately eternal destiny.</p>
<p>In asking the question, Pilate is “<em>dismissing the whole idea that there is such a thing as absolute truth</em>”. He is dismissing that there is a right and there is wrong. We live in a society that has dismissed the notion of absolute truth and clear right and wrongs. Most people, including a majority of Christians, no longer believe in absolute moral and spiritual truth – instead they believe truth is relative which means i.e. <em>whatever I want to believe and whatever I think is right is truth or whatever is right for me is truth.</em></p>
<p>Today if you ask the question, “what is truth”, you get a whole bunch of different answers - truth is whatever I want it to be; truth is whatever feels right for me; truth is within me; truth is what is right for me; truth is what feels right for me. Truth becomes what is right for me, instead of what has God said.</p>
<p>Because society has rejected the notion of absolute truth, there is no such thing as clear right and wrong any more. If I want to have premarital sex, that it is right for me. If I want a divorce, you can’t stop me because its right be me. If I want to practice homosexuality, it is ok because that is right for me.</p>
<p>The core issue underlying all of these things how one defines truth and and where does truth come from? We will look at the sources of truth. For now, I leave you to consider, where is your source of truth and how do you determine what is right and wrong?</p>
<h2 id="sources-of-truth">Sources of Truth</h2>
<p><strong>John 17:17</strong> <em>ΓÇªYour word is truth.</em> NKJV</p>
<p>We saw how we live in a society that has dismissed the notion of absolute truth and define truth as what feels good or what is right for them or what the courts or government decides. Truth has now become whatever is right for you. As a result, we Americans think we can do almost whatever we want.</p>
<p>Let’s take a brief look where people get their truth:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What they believe. To some, whatever they believe, is right and true for them. If someone wants to steal something and no one gets hurt, that becomes ok for them. What happens when what you believe contradicts what I believe? Obviously individuals cannot determine their own source of truth because one says abortion is ok and other says it is not. Someone has to be wrong. They both cannot be right.</p></li>
<li><p>What they were taught as a child. There are parents who teach their kids to hate African Americans. Obviously our parents cannot be the infallible source of truth.</p></li>
<li><p>What feels right to them? Some people feel it is ok to have multiple partners or feel right stealing from the government. But what happens when what feels right to me conflicts with what feels right to you and my truth conflicts with your truth? Obviously individuals cannot determine their own source of truth because one says homosexuality is ok and other says it is not. Someone has to be wrong. They both cannot be right.</p></li>
<li><p>What the government, courts or people collectively say is right. The people and government in Germany thought it was ok to kill six million Jews. Obviously the government, collective will of the people or a human court, can not decide what is truth and what is right or wrong.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is for these reasons that truth must come from outside of humanity. This is called absolute truth. It is a truth that exists regardless of your opinion or mine.</p>
<p>The core issue remains - how one defines truth and and where does truth come from?</p>
<h2 id="absolute-truth">Absolute Truth</h2>
<p><strong>John 17:17</strong> <em>ΓÇªYour word is truth.</em> NKJV</p>
<p>We saw that people have many sources of truth but that none of them provide a solid basis for right and wrong. The Bible is very clear that there is such a thing as ABSOLUTE TRUTH.</p>
<p>Absolute truth is truth that provides the standard for all right and wrong and all morality. Absolute truth says that right and wrong is determined by what God says (not by what I believe). Absolute truth says that right and wrong, morality and truth exist outside of what I believe. Absolute truth comes not from someone’s opinion, not what you think, not what I think, not what the church thinks, but what God has said. It is truth that comes from God and His Word. It is truth that does not depend on what one feels, what one thinks, what society says or the culture we live in. Absolute truth does not change with time, society, history, culture, or our personal situation. It is truth that allows one to say this is wrong or this is right – regardless of what anyone, including the government, says or thinks. It is truth that consists of having the same idea about something that God has. (Joseph Joubert). It is truth that is the standard by which everything else is measured. It is truth that gives people a right to say, “<em>It is not lawfulΓÇª”</em></p>
<p>Absolute truth stands in contrast to relative truth. Relative truth is truth is based on what you think, feel or perceive. Relative truth is that which can change with the person or situation or time. Relative truth says that there is no such thing as moral or spiritual truth, no such thing as right or wrong, all religion is equally valid and equally true. Relative truth says that right and wrong is determined by what I believe, not by what God says. Relative truth is truth that is based on what you believe is right for you. Relative truth defines what is right and wrong for us ourselves apart from God’s Word.</p>
<p>Absolute vs relative truth as illustrated with Adam and Eve. Absolute truth says it was wrong to eat from the tree because God said so. Relative truth believes it was only wrong for Eve to eat from the tree if Eve thought it was wrong, if she thought it was ok then it is ok. Certainly no one can tell her it was wrong.</p>
<p>Absolute vs relative truth as illustrated with David’s Adultery. Absolute truth says it was wrong to commit adultery with Bathsheba because God says so. Relative truth says I don’t believe adultery is wrong, as long as the adults are consenting or are in love.</p>
<p>The Bible never waivers as to the existence of an absolute truth that comes from God’s Holy Word and is based on His unchanging character.</p>
<p>The basis for all truth is God Himself.</p>

<p><em>Prayer: Father God, you are a God of Truth. Help me to be a person of conviction and truth. I repent of setting up my own system of truth apart from the truth of Your Word.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-age-we-live-in">The Age we Live In</h2>
<p>When it comes to truth, we live in age where people:</p>
<ol type="A">

<li><p>The first thing we see in Pilate’s question is “truth dismissed”</p>

</ol></li>
<li><p><em><strong>TRUTH BECOMES – WHAT IS RIGHT FOR ME<br />
</strong></em></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Truth becomes what we think, feel, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Because there is no king, everyone does what is right in their own eyes</p></li>
<li><p>Everyone one of us defines what is right and wrong for us ourselves – apart from God’s Word</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>People speak about “my truth” without realizing “their truth” is just an opinion.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Seek to suppress the truth<br />
</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Jesus tried to bring truth out, but both Pilate and the Jewish leaders wanted to kill it</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rom 1:18</strong> <em>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,</em> NASU</p></li>

<li><p><u>Can not recognize truth<br />
</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Here is Pilate standing before Him who is “the truth” and He can not even recognize Him</p></li>
<li><p>In the age we live in, people can not even recognize truth when it is right before them</p></li>
<li><p>Even in the midst of broken relationships caused by sex outside of marriage, they still fail to recognize the truth</p></li>
<li><p>You try to tell someone this is right or this is wrong and they can not recognize it</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>This attitude of dismissing, rejecting and not recognizing truth has invaded our entire society</p>
<p><em><strong>As believers, we are called to “bear witness to the truth” and those who hear His voice are of the truth</strong></em></p>
<h2 id="truth-cannot-be-separated-from-love">Truth Cannot Be Separated From Love<u><br />
</u></h2>
<p><strong>1Cor 13:6</strong> <em>{love} does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;</em> NKJV</p>
<p><strong>2 John 1</strong> <em>The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth ; ΓÇª</em>NAS</p>
<p>It is possible to be sincere and sincerely wrong. Many people today think they can have love without truth. The Bible is clear, you cannot have genuine love apart from truth. Love always wants the best for someone and truth always is the best for someone. If you say you have love apart from truth, it no longer ceases to be love. It is impossible for homosexuals to “be in love” because they are not in truth.</p>
<p>God is love and God is truth. Love is the force behind truth. Love requires truth. We live in a feel good age that wants to separate the idea of “love” from “truth”. Sin cannot be condemned anymore, we just “need to love everyone”. This is not love. Love speaks the truth. Love lives in truth. God’s motivation behind the law is love. It may seem easier not to tell someone the truth, thinking you are loving them, but the reality is you are acutally harming them which is why we are called to “speak the truth in love” and to “love in truth”.</p>
<h2 id="jesus-reigns-in-our-life-through-acceptance-and-obedience-to-the-truth">Jesus Reigns in Our Life through Acceptance and Obedience to the Truth</h2>
<p><strong>John 18:37</strong> <em>Pilate therefore said to Him, “Are You a king then?” Jesus answered, “You say rightly that I am a king. For this cause I was born, and for this cause I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.”</em> NKJV</p>
<p>One of the charges the Jewish religious leaders brought against Jesus was that He claimed to be a king. And so Pilate asks if Jesus is a king because this would be a threat to Caesar and to Rome.</p>
<p>Jesus reply is interesting. Jesus says “yes I am a king” but I did not come to forcefully establish my kingdom, I came to testify and bear witness to truth. In essence, Jesus is saying to Pilate, I am not like an earthly king who will use power and coercion to establish their kingdom. Instead truth will be how I establish my kingdom,” <em>“I reign through truth, not force”</em>. Truth is what brings people to let me reign in their life<em>.</em> Jesus is saying, “I reign in people’s lives by truth and not by force”. This is critical for us to understand. Truth received, believed and lived out through obedience is what releases Jesus’ reign in our life. He goes on to add “<em>Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice</em>”. In other words, people who are of the truth listen to Jesus’ voice, because is He is the very embodiment to all truth.</p>
<p>The important lesson for us today is to recognize that Jesus reigns in our life, not through force, but through humble and submissive acceptance and obedience to the truth of His Word.</p>
<p><em>Prayer: Father in Heaven, I confess Jesus is Lord, not only with my mouth, but also by accepting His reign of truth in me. Jesus, I yield my life to You. I choose to hear, obey and live in the truth of Your Word. Amen.</em></p>
<h2 id="truth-is-something-to-be-lived-and-not-just-to-be-believed">Truth is something to be lived and not just to be believed</h2>
<p><strong>2John 4</strong> <em>I rejoiced greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truthΓÇª</em>NKJV</p>
<p>We live in an hour where many are are deceived into thinking that truth is something only to be believed. This is especially true of the religious spirit which mistakenly thinks truth is something only to be believed. People frequently think that believing the right doctrine and having the right creed and profession is all that matters. While believing the right doctrine and hav this certainly is true, it is possible to believe truth with the mind and still be deceived.</p>
<p>In this verse, John rejoices that there were some people who were “walking in truth” or in other words, they were living what they believed. It is deception to think that truth is only something to be believed. John does not speak of believing truth, he speaks of “<em>walking in truth</em>”. I repeat, it is a deception to think you can believe something and not live it.</p>
<p>We live what we truly believe. Only truth embraced is truth believed. If truth does not change your life, you really don’t believe it. How we live when no one is watching manifests what we truly believe. no one is watching Many people profess to “believe in Jesus Christ on Sunday, but then do not live what they believe the rest of the time. This is the context behind John’s writing. John is addressing the false teachers who had the right words, but the wrong actions and life-style. This is why John says in the first letter writes there are many anti-Christs - people who profess Jesus but don’t walk in what they profess to believe.</p>
<p>One cannot say I believe in a Holy God and then choose to live an immoral, unholy life-style. One cannot say I believe in a God who is in control and then not yield the reigns of your life to Him. One cannot say Jesus is the most important person in my life and not give Him two thoughts during the week</p>
<p>The simple point is truth is something to be lived and not just to be believed. Are you walking in truth today?</p>
<p><em>Prayer: My Father in Heaven, I have a simple prayer. I want to walk in what I believe. I want my life to reflect my profession and what I claim to believe. Help me where I fall short. Please bring me out of all deception. In Jesus’ name. Amen.<br />

<h2 id="the-benefits-of-walking-in-truth"><br />
The Benefits of Walking in Truth</h2>
<p><strong>Pro 23:23</strong> <em>Buy the truth, and sell it not;</em> ΓÇª(KJV)</p>
<p>Here we read Solomon in his wisdom tell encourage us to “buy the truth” which tells us truth is valuable. There is very real value and very real benefits from embracing and walking in truth.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Truth is a key to a healthy mind</u> (Phil 4:8). Could this be why there is so much mental illness in today– because we for the most part as a society have abandoned truth? We embrace sin and falsehood instead of truth.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Truth is the only way God may be found and known</u> (John 14:6, Deu 32:4). Jesus is THE truth. Not just that His sayings are true but He is The Truth. Jesus is “the true, genuine, and ultimate reality. “In Jesus, God is present, unveiled, undistorted, in His infinite depth, in His unapproachable mystery” (Paul Tillich). The preciousness and value of the truth is that through Jesus Christ, THE TRUTH, we can find, meet and know our Creator and our God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Truth brings God near</u> (Psa 145:18) If you are wondering where God is in your life, have you called upon Him in truth? Stop pretending and simply trust in His mercy, and open the dark areas of your soul to His Truth and you will find Him drawing near like a moth to a flame.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Truth brings freedom</u> (John 8:32). When you encounter and possess within your soul, the truth that is in Christ and the truth of what He has done for you on the cross, you experience a truth that liberates - from the feebleness of self, from enslaving anxieties, from evil desires, from inwardly warring hostilities, from guilt, from shame, from both a wrong self-rejection and self-affirmation. Truth liberates us from these things into an unconditional love and assurance of our eternal salvation</p></li>
<li><p><u>Truth keeps us from destroying ourselves</u> (Psa 119:105). The truth of God’s word is a light to guide and direct. It is truth that is a light to show us what is right. Without truth, everyone lives however they feel like it whose end results in misery, unhappiness, hurt and destruction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Space prohibits me from reviewing the countless other benefits that truth brings to our life: hope, stability, correction, and guidance. Understand there is value to walking in truth which is why we encouraged to “buy the truth and not sell it”.</p>
<p><em>Prayer: God, I believe you are a God of truth. I believe Jesus is the Truth. I believe Your Word is Truth. Grant me faith to trust your truth. Help me to be a person who lives, breathes, walks and rests in truth. In Jesus’ name I pray. Amen.<br />
</em></p>
<h2 id="the-truth-will-cost-you">The Truth Will Cost You</h2>
<p><strong>Pro 23:23</strong> <em>Buy the truth, and sell it not;</em> ΓÇª(KJV)</p>
<p>There is a cost to obtaining and walking in truth. There is a cost to living in truth. As we see from this Proverb, truth is not free. Truth costs something to obtain – it must be bought and purchased. The fact that we are told to “buy” truth means it will cost me something.<br />
<br />
Many people through out the Scriptures would not pay the cost of truth</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Herod put John the Baptist in prison because John told him it was not lawful to commit adultery with his brother’s wife. Herod knew John was right; yet he did not want to pay the price and give up his adultery. There is a cost to walking in truth - you may have to change what you are doing or what you want to do.</p></li>
<li><p>The Bible says the Pharisees “kept silent” when Jesus asked them if it was lawful to do good on the Sabbath (Mark 3:4). The Pharisees did not answer because they knew Jesus was right. They could not pay the cost of admitting they were wrong, or what they believed was wrong. There is a cost to walking in truth - you may have to change your beliefs.</p></li>
<li><p>The self-righteous Pharisee in Luke 18 could not repent or admit his wrongs and sins because he was full of religious pride. There is a cost to walking in truth – you may have to admit you are wrong, humble yourself and repoent of your pride.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a cost to walking in truth. There is a cost to buy the truth and pressure to sell it. Not only does it cost you to obtain it, it costs you to retain it. You will have to pay a price to keep the truth you have already paid a price to get.</p>
<p>Many people through out the Scriptures sold the truth for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><div class="list-paragraph">
<p>Saul abandoned the truth because of the pressure of the Amalekites pressing in on him. Let’s not be too hard on Saul however as</p>
</div>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Same is often true in our lives – abandon the truth because of pressure</p></li>
<li><p>Financial pressure may squeeze you into doing something that you know is not right</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Esau – sold the truth to meet his immediate need</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>In order to meet his immediate need, he was willing to sell the truth</p></li>
<li><p>When needs begin to press in upon our lives, will we sell the truth to meet the immediate need?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Herod’s peer pressure</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>He knew John was a holy and just man</p></li>
<li><p>Yet when Herodias asked for John’s head in public, Herod gave in because he was concerned about what people might think about him</p></li>
<li><p>Peer pressure and what people thought caused him to sell the truth</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>The simple point is that there is a cost to keep the truth i.e. there is pressure to sell it. The cost to truth could be our pride, money, a relationship, friends, a job, or even family.</p>
<p><strong>The willingness to pay the cost to obtain and retain truth is where the rubber meets the road of our Christianity</strong></p>
<p>There is a cost to walking in truth. Are you willing to pay it?</p>
