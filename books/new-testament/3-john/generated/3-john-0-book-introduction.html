<h2 id="john-book-introduction">3 John — Book Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="what-this-book-is-about">What This Book Is About</h3>
<p>The book of 3 John is about walking in truth and how that truth shows
up in real life, especially in the church.</p>
<p>This is the shortest book in the New Testament, but it addresses some
of the most important issues believers face:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How we treat people</p></li>
<li><p>How leadership should function</p></li>
<li><p>How pride, personal preferences and self-exaltation, all damage
the church God’s work</p></li>
<li><p>How faith is proven through action</p></li>
</ul>
<p>3 John shows us that truth is not just something we believe. It is
something we live. And how we live it affects others.</p>
<h3 id="who-wrote-this-book">Who Wrote This Book</h3>
<p>This letter was written by John, the same man who wrote the Gospel of
John, 1 John, and 2 John.</p>
<p>John refers to himself simply as <strong>“</strong>the elder.” He is
writing as a spiritual father, not as someone trying to assert rank or
authority. His concern is not control, but care.</p>
<p>By the time this letter was written, John had walked with Christ for
decades. He had seen churches grow strong and churches break apart. This
letter reflects wisdom gained through long faithfulness.</p>
<h3 id="who-this-book-was-written-to">Who This Book Was Written To</h3>
<p>This letter is written to a believer named Gaius.</p>
<p>Unlike many New Testament letters, this one is not written to a whole
church. It is written to one man. That alone tells us something
important i.e. God cares about individual faithfulness, not just large
movements.</p>
<p>Gaius is commended throughout the letter for walking in truth,
showing love, and supporting God’s work. He represents what healthy
Christian living looks like.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-book-was-written">Why This Book Was Written</h3>
<p>John writes this letter for three main reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To encourage faithfulness: John wants Gaius to know that his
quiet, steady obedience matters and is seen.</p></li>
<li><p>To affirm or highlight a godly example for others: John
highlights Gaius and Demetrius as models of believers whose lives align
with truth.</p></li>
<li><p>To warn against unhealthy leadership: John confronts the example
of Diotrephes, a man who loves control, rejects accountability, and
harms the church through pride.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This book shows the problems that can arise from within from
self-seeking leaders and people.</p>
<h3 id="major-themes-in-3-john">Major Themes in 3 John</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Truth is not what you believe, it is what you live Belief and
behavior are inseparable.</p></li>
<li><p>Genuine faith is expressed through love and shows itself in
hospitality, generosity, and support of others.</p></li>
<li><p>The difference between healthy and unhealthy leadership. Godly
leadership serves others. Ungodly leadership seeks personal preferences,
self-exaltation, control and recognition.</p></li>
<li><p>Those who support faithful servants of God become fellow workers
for the truth.</p></li>
<li><p>The danger of pride. The desire to be first always damages unity
and blocks God’s work.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="why-3-john-matters-today">Why 3 John Matters Today</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We still need believers who walk and live out quietly and
faithfully as opposed to merely believing truth.</p></li>
<li><p>We still need leaders who serve and seek to empower others
instead of control.</p></li>
<li><p>We still need discernment about who we follow and
imitate.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This book teaches us that faithfulness is often unseen, but never
unimportant. God advances His work through people who love truth and
live it out.</p>
