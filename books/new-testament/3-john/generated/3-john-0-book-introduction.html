<h2 id="what-this-book-is-about">What This Book Is About</h2>
<div>
<p>The book of 3 John is about <span data-custom-style="Strong">walking in truth</span> and how that truth shows up in real life, especially in the church.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This is the shortest book in the New Testament, but it addresses some of the most important issues believers face:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>How we treat people</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>How leadership should function</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>How pride, personal preferences and self-exaltation, all damage the church God’s work</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>How faith is proven through action</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>3 John shows us that truth is not just something we believe. It is something we live. And how we live it affects others.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="who-wrote-this-book">Who Wrote This Book</h2>
<div>
<p>This letter was written by <span data-custom-style="Strong">John</span>, the same man who wrote the Gospel of John, 1 John, and 2 John.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>John refers to himself simply as <span data-custom-style="Strong">“the elder.”</span> He is writing as a spiritual father, not as someone trying to assert rank or authority. His concern is not control, but care.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>By the time this letter was written, John had walked with Christ for decades. He had seen churches grow strong and churches break apart. This letter reflects wisdom gained through long faithfulness.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="who-this-book-was-written-to">Who This Book Was Written To</h2>
<div>
<p>This letter is written to a believer named <span data-custom-style="Strong">Gaius</span>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Unlike many New Testament letters, this one is not written to a whole church. It is written to one man. That alone tells us something important i.e. God cares about individual faithfulness, not just large movements.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Gaius is commended throughout the letter for walking in truth, showing love, and supporting God’s work. He represents what healthy Christian living looks like.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="why-this-book-was-written">Why This Book Was Written</h2>
<div>
<p>John writes this letter for three main reasons.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>To encourage faithfulness: John wants Gaius to know that his quiet, steady obedience matters and is seen.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>To affirm or highlight a godly example for others: John highlights Gaius and Demetrius as models of believers whose lives align with truth.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>To warn against unhealthy leadership: John confronts the example of Diotrephes, a man who loves control, rejects accountability, and harms the church through pride.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>This book shows the problems that can arise from within from self-seeking leaders and people.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="major-themes-in-3-john">Major Themes in 3 John</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Truth is not what you believe, it is what you live Belief and behavior are inseparable.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Genuine faith is expressed through love and shows itself in hospitality, generosity, and support of others.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>The difference between healthy and unhealthy leadership. Godly leadership serves others. Ungodly leadership seeks personal preferences, self-exaltation, control and recognition.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Those who support faithful servants of God become fellow workers for the truth.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">

</ol>
<h2 id="why-3-john-matters-today">Why 3 John Matters Today</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>We still need believers who walk and live out quietly and faithfully as opposed to merely believing truth.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>We still need leaders who serve and seek to empower others instead of control.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>We still need discernment about who we follow and imitate.</p>
</div></li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>This book teaches us that faithfulness is often unseen, but never unimportant. God advances His work through people who love truth and live it out.</p>
