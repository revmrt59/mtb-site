<h2 id="john-1-explanation">3 John 1 – Explanation</h2>
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:1</strong> <em>The Elder, To the beloved
Gaius, whom I love in truth:</em> (NKJV)</mark></p>
<p>This letter opens in a very personal way.</p>
<p>John starts by calling himself <strong>“the elder.”</strong> He is
not trying to impress anyone with a title. He is writing as a spiritual
father, someone with maturity, authority, and care for God’s people.
This already tells us the letter is relational, not formal or
distant.</p>
<p>He is writing <strong>to Gaius</strong>, a real believer and a real
friend. This is not a general church letter. It is one person writing to
another person.</p>
<p>John says he <strong>loves Gaius “in truth.”</strong> That matters.
He is not just saying, “I like you” or “we get along.” His love is
grounded in God’s truth. In other words, their relationship is shaped by
their shared faith in Christ and by walking in what is right. This is
love that is sincere, honest, and spiritually grounded.</p>
<p>So right from the start, this verse teaches us something
important:<br />
Christian leadership is personal, Christian love is rooted in truth, and
faith is meant to be lived out in real relationships.</p>
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:2</strong> <em>Beloved, I pray that you may
prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers.</em>
(NKJV)</mark><br />
<br />
John begins this verse with <strong>“Beloved.”</strong> That word
matters. He is not correcting Gaius. He is not warning him. He is
speaking to someone he genuinely cares about. Everything that follows
comes from affection, not authority.</p>
<p>John then says he <strong>prays</strong> for Gaius. This tells us
something about godly leadership and friendship: John doesn’t just think
well of Gaius, he brings him before God. Prayer is how John supports
him.</p>
<p>What does John pray for?</p>
<p>First, that Gaius <strong>would prosper in all things.</strong> This
is not about greed or excess. It simply means John wants things to go
well for him in life. He wants his work, responsibilities, and daily
affairs to be healthy and fruitful.</p>
<p>Second, that he <strong>would be in health.</strong> John cares about
Gaius as a whole person. Faith is not disconnected from real life.
Physical well-being matters to God and to God’s people.</p>
<p>But then John adds something very important:<br />
<strong>“just as your soul prospers.”</strong></p>
<p>This is the key to the verse.</p>
<p>John is saying, “I hope your outer life matches your inner life.”
Gaius is already doing well spiritually. His faith is strong. His walk
with God is healthy. John’s prayer is that his physical life and
circumstances would reflect that same spiritual health.</p>
<p>So this verse teaches us balance. God cares about the soul first, but
He also cares about the rest of life. True prosperity starts on the
inside and works its way outward.</p>
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:3</strong> <em>For I rejoiced greatly when
brethren came and testified of the truth that is in you, just as you
walk in the truth.</em> (NKJV)</mark></p>
<p>John now explains <strong>why</strong> he is confident that Gaius’s
soul is doing well.</p>
<p>He says he <strong>rejoiced greatly</strong> when other believers
came and reported about Gaius. That tells us something important:
Gaius’s faith was visible. People noticed it. His life left an
impression on others.</p>
<p>What did they report?</p>
<p>They testified to <strong>the truth that is in him</strong>. This
does not mean Gaius just knew correct doctrine. It means God’s truth had
taken root in his life. Truth lived inside him, shaped his choices, and
showed up in how he treated people.</p>
<p>Then John adds this phrase: <strong>“just as you walk in the
truth.”</strong></p>
<p>This is huge.</p>
<p>Gaius didn’t just believe the truth. He <strong>walked</strong> in
it. His daily life matched what he believed. His behavior lined up with
his confession. Faith was not theoretical for him; it was practical.</p>
<p>So verse 3 teaches us a simple but powerful lesson:<br />
Spiritual health is proven by how someone lives, not just by what they
say they believe.</p>
<p>John rejoices because Gaius’s faith is steady, visible, and
consistent. The truth is not just in his head; it is guiding his
steps.</p>
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:4</strong> <em>I have no greater joy than to
hear that my children walk in truth.</em> (NKJV)</mark></p>
<p>This is one of the most personal statements John ever makes, and it
really shows his heart as a spiritual father.</p>
<p>He says, <strong>“I have no greater joy than to hear that my children
walk in truth.”</strong> That is not exaggeration. John means it.</p>
<p>John has lived a long life. He has seen churches grow, churches
struggle, leaders rise, and leaders fall. He has experienced
persecution, conflict, and loss. Out of all of that, he tells us what
brings him the <strong>greatest joy</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is not success.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not numbers.<br />
It is not reputation.</p></li>
<li><p>It is seeing believers <strong>continue</strong> to walk in
truth.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When John calls them <strong>“my children,”</strong> he is speaking
as a spiritual father. These are people he has poured into, taught,
prayed for, and cared about. Their faith matters deeply to him.</p>
<p>And notice the word <strong>“walk.”</strong> This is not about a
single good moment or one strong decision. It is about a steady, ongoing
way of life. John’s joy comes from seeing people stay faithful over
time.</p>
<p>This verse teaches us something foundational:<br />
The true measure of spiritual success is not how someone starts, but how
they walk.</p>
<p>For John, nothing is more rewarding than knowing the truth he
preached is now being lived out in the lives of others.</p>
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:5</strong> <em>Beloved, you do faithfully
whatever you do for the brethren and for strangers,</em>
(NKJV)</mark></p>
<p>John begins again with the word <strong>“Beloved.”</strong> This
reminds us that what he is about to say comes from encouragement, not
criticism.</p>
<p>He tells Gaius that he is acting <strong>faithfully</strong> in what
he does. That word means dependable, trustworthy, and consistent. Gaius
is not just sincere; he is reliable in how he lives out his faith.</p>
<p>What exactly is Gaius doing?</p>
<p>John points to how he treats <strong>the brethren and
strangers</strong>. In other words, Gaius shows love not only to
believers he knows well, but also to believers he has never met before.
These “strangers” are traveling Christians, likely people serving God
who depended on the hospitality of others.</p>
<p>This tells us something important about real faith:<br />
It shows up in how we treat people when there is no personal
benefit.</p>
<p>Gaius did not help others because it was convenient or because he
would get something back. He did it because it was right. He lived out
the truth he believed by opening his life to others.</p>
<p>So verse 5 teaches us that faithfulness is proven through action.
Walking in truth always leads to loving service.</p>
<p>Gaius didn’t just believe correctly; he lived generously.</p>
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:6</strong> <em>who have borne witness of your
love before the church. If you send them forward on their journey in a
manner worthy of God, you will do well,</em> (NKJV)</mark></p>
<p>John now shows the <strong>result</strong> of Gaius’s
faithfulness.</p>
<p>He says these believers <strong>have borne witness of your love
before the church</strong>. That means Gaius’s actions didn’t stay
private. People talked about them. His love was noticeable and worth
reporting.</p>
<p>This is important:<br />
Gaius wasn’t trying to be seen, but his love was seen.</p>
<p>John then encourages him to <strong>send them forward on their
journey in a manner worthy of God</strong>. In other words, “Keep doing
what you’re doing, and do it in a way that reflects God’s
character.”</p>
<p>This isn’t just about being polite or generous. John raises the
standard very high. Helping God’s servants should reflect
how <strong>God Himself</strong> would treat them. That means care,
honor, and generosity.</p>
<p>So verse 6 teaches us something practical and foundational:<br />
How we treat God’s people reflects what we believe about God.</p>
<p>Gaius understood that serving others was not just kindness, it was
worship. His hospitality became a testimony to the whole church.</p>
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:7</strong> <em>because they went forth for His
name’s sake, taking nothing from the Gentiles.</em> (NKJV)</mark></p>
<p>Here John explains why supporting these traveling believers matters
so much.</p>
<p>He says they went out <strong>“for the sake of the
Name.”</strong> That phrase is powerful. John doesn’t even need to say
the name of Jesus. Everyone knows who he means. These people left their
homes, comfort, and security to serve Christ and make Him known.</p>
<p>They were not chasing attention or profit. They were motivated by
loyalty to Jesus.</p>
<p>John then adds that they <strong>took nothing from the
Gentiles</strong>. In simple terms, they didn’t ask unbelievers to
support God’s work. They didn’t want the message of Christ mixed with
money, pressure, or obligation from those who didn’t yet believe.</p>
<p>This is where Gaius comes in.</p>
<p>Because these workers depended on fellow believers for support,
hospitality was not optional. It was essential. Without people like
Gaius, their work could not continue.</p>
<p>So verse 7 teaches us this:<br />
God often chooses to advance His work through the faithfulness of
ordinary believers.</p>
<p>Gaius may not have been traveling or preaching, but by supporting
those who did, he became a partner in the work of the gospel.</p>
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:8</strong> <em>We therefore ought to receive
such, that we may become fellow workers for the truth.</em>
(NKJV)</mark></p>
<p>John now makes the principle clear.</p>
<p>He says <strong>“we therefore ought to receive such”</strong>. This
is not a suggestion. It is a responsibility. Believers have a role to
play in supporting those who serve Christ.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>So that <strong>we may become fellow workers for the
truth</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the heart of the verse.</p>
<p>John is teaching that not everyone serves God in the same way, but
everyone can share in the work. Some go. Some teach. Some travel. Others
support, host, give, and encourage. All of it counts.</p>
<p>Gaius may not have been preaching in new places, but through his
generosity and hospitality, he became a <strong>partner</strong> in the
spread of the truth. God sees his support as real participation, not
second-class service.</p>
<p>So verse 8 teaches us a foundational truth:<br />
You don’t have to be visible to be vital in God’s work.</p>
<p>Supporting the truth is the same as working for the truth.</p>
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:9</strong> <em>I wrote to the church, but
Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, does not
receive us.</em> (NKJV)</mark></p>
<p>Up to this point, John has been encouraging and affirming. Now he
introduces a problem.</p>
<p>John says he <strong>wrote to the church</strong>, but then he
mentions a man named <strong>Diotrephes</strong>. This is the first
negative example in the letter, and John does not soften it.</p>
<p>He says Diotrephes <strong>“loves to have the preeminence among
them.”</strong> That phrase means Diotrephes wants to be first. He wants
control, attention, and authority. Leadership, for him, is about
position, not service.</p>
<p>Because of this, John says Diotrephes <strong>does not receive
us</strong>. In other words, he rejects apostolic authority. He is not
teachable. He decides who gets heard and who doesn’t.</p>
<p>This verse teaches a hard but important lesson:<br />
Someone can be active in church life and still be driven by pride.</p>
<p>Diotrephes stands in sharp contrast to Gaius. Gaius opens his life to
others. Diotrephes shuts people out. Gaius supports God’s work.
Diotrephes protects his own status.</p>
<p>John includes this verse to show that walking in truth is not just
about belief, it’s about humility.</p>
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:10</strong> <em>Therefore, if I come, I will
call to mind his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious
words. And not content with that, he himself does not receive the
brethren, and forbids those who wish to, putting them out of the
church.</em> (NKJV)</mark></p>
<p>Here John explains what Diotrephes is actually doing.</p>
<p>First, John says, <strong>“If I come, I will call to mind his
deeds.”</strong> That tells us two things. John is aware of what’s
happening, and he is not afraid to address it. Godly leadership does not
ignore harmful behavior just to keep peace.</p>
<p>Then John lists the problems.</p>
<p>Diotrephes is <strong>speaking malicious words</strong>. That means
he is using harmful, false, or exaggerated speech. His words are tearing
people down, not building them up. This is how pride often shows itself:
through speech that damages others.</p>
<p>But John says that isn’t even enough for him.</p>
<p>Diotrephes <strong>does not receive the brethren</strong>. He refuses
to welcome faithful believers. He closes the door to people God has
sent.</p>
<p>Worse still, he <strong>forbids those who want to receive
them</strong>. In other words, he controls others through fear or
pressure. He doesn’t just refuse hospitality himself; he stops others
from showing it.</p>
<p>Finally, John says he <strong>puts them out of the church</strong>.
This is serious. Diotrephes is using authority to punish people for
doing what is right.</p>
<p>This verse teaches a sobering lesson:<br />
Pride in leadership always harms the community.</p>
<p>Diotrephes uses position to protect himself, not to serve others. His
actions stand in total contrast to Gaius, who opened his life to serve
the truth.</p>
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:11</strong> <em>Beloved, do not imitate what
is evil, but what is good. He who does good is of God, but he who does
evil has not seen God.</em> (NKJV)</mark></p>
<p>John now speaks directly and personally to Gaius.</p>
<p>He begins again with <strong>“Beloved.”</strong> Even when addressing
serious issues, John leads with care. This is instruction rooted in
relationship.</p>
<p>Then he gives a clear command:<br />
<strong>“Do not imitate what is evil, but what is good.”</strong></p>
<p>John is saying, “You have choices. You are watching two different
examples play out in real life.” On one side is Diotrephes, driven by
pride and control. On the other side is Gaius, marked by humility,
generosity, and faithfulness.</p>
<p>John makes the line very clear.</p>
<p><strong>“He who does good is of God.”</strong><br />
That does not mean earning salvation. It means that a life yielded by
God will naturally produce goodness.</p>
<p><strong>“He who does evil has not seen God.”</strong><br />
This is strong language. John is not saying Diotrephes has never heard
about God. He is saying his behavior shows a lack of true understanding
of who God is. You cannot truly see or know who God is and consistently
act in ways that oppose His character.</p>
<p>So verse 11 teaches a foundational truth:<br />
Belief and behavior are connected. Walking in truth will show itself in
how we treat people.</p>
<p>John is cautioning us, “be careful who we choose to copy and
follow.”</p>
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:12</strong> <em>Demetrius has a good testimony
from all, and from the truth itself. And we also bear witness, and you
know that our testimony is true.</em> (NKJV)</mark></p>
<p>After warning about Diotrephes, John now points to a healthy
example.</p>
<p>He introduces a man named <strong>Demetrius</strong> and says that
he <strong>has a good testimony from all</strong>. That means people
consistently speak well of him. His character is not questionable or
mixed. Over time, his life has proven trustworthy.</p>
<p>But John doesn’t stop there.</p>
<p>He says Demetrius also has a good testimony <strong>from the truth
itself</strong>. In other words, his life lines up with God’s truth. If
you compare how he lives with what Scripture teaches, they match.</p>
<p>Then John adds, <strong>“and we also bear witness.”</strong> John
personally vouches for him. This is strong affirmation. John is saying,
“I know this man, and I stand behind him.”</p>
<p>Finally, John says, <strong>“and you know that our testimony is
true.”</strong> John appeals to the trust that already exists between
him and Gaius. This isn’t manipulation. It’s relational credibility.</p>
<p>Demetrius doesn’t need to defend himself. His life speaks for him. He
stands in contrast to Diotrephes, whose actions exposed his heart.</p>
<p><mark><strong>3 John 1:13-14</strong> <em>3John 13 I had many things
to write, but I do not wish to write to you with pen and ink; 3John 14
but I hope to see you shortly, and we shall speak face to face. Peace to
you. Our friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.</em>
(NKJV)</mark></p>
<p>John closes the letter the same way he began it: personally and
relationally.</p>
<p>He says he has <strong>many things to write</strong>, but he doesn’t
want to do it with pen and ink. This tells us the relationship matters
more than the information. John values presence over paperwork.</p>
<p>Then he says he <strong>hopes to see Gaius shortly</strong>, so they
can speak <strong>face to face</strong>. This is important. Some things
are better handled in person, especially encouragement, correction, and
shared joy. John is not trying to manage everything from a distance.</p>
<p>Next, he says, <strong>“Peace to you.”</strong> This is not a casual
goodbye. Peace is the settled well-being that comes from walking in
truth and right relationships. After addressing conflict, pride, and
faithfulness, John speaks peace over Gaius’s life.</p>
<p>Finally, John says, <strong>“Our friends greet you. Greet the friends
by name.”</strong> This small line says a lot. Christianity is not
anonymous. People matter. Names matter. Relationships matter.</p>
<p>So the letter ends where it began: with truth lived out in real
relationships.</p>
<p>These verses quietly reinforce the foundation of the whole
book:<br />
Faith is personal. Truth is relational. Leadership is about people, not
control.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>3 John is very simple but also very relevant. It shows
us <strong>three lives</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gaius, who walks in truth</p></li>
<li><p>Diotrephes, who loves control</p></li>
<li><p>Demetrius, whose life matches the truth</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And it asks us, without saying it out loud:<br />
<em>Which example will you follow?</em></p>
