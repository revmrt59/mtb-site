<h3 id="john-chapter-orientation">3 John — Chapter Orientation</h3>
<h2 id="chapter-theme">Chapter Theme</h2>
<p>Walking in truth is revealed through faithful love, humble
leadership, and support of God’s work.</p>
<h3 id="purpose-of-this-chapter">Purpose of This Chapter</h3>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to show how truth is lived out in real
church life. John affirms faithful believers who walk in truth, warns
against prideful and controlling leadership, and teaches that supporting
the work of the gospel makes believers partners in the truth.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-summary">Chapter Summary</h3>
<p>In this chapter, John writes to a man named Gaius to encourage him in
his faithful walk in the truth. John affirms that Gaius’s spiritual life
is healthy and that his faith is visible through love and hospitality
toward fellow believers, including those he does not personally know.
John explains that those who support such servants of Christ become
fellow workers for the truth.</p>
<p>John then contrasts this godly example with Diotrephes, a man who
seeks prominence, rejects apostolic authority, and harms the church
through malicious speech and exclusion. John warns believers not to
imitate what is evil but to follow what is good. He commends Demetrius
as a trustworthy example and closes the letter with a personal
expression of peace and relationship.</p>

</ol>
<h3 id="key-words-and-concepts">Key Words and Concepts</h3>
<p>Truth: Truth in this chapter is not just correct belief, but God’s
reality lived out in daily life. It is something a believer walks in,
not merely mental belief or agreement.</p>
<p>Walk: To walk means to live in a consistent, ongoing way. It
describes how faith shows up in everyday choices, behavior, and
relationships.</p>
<p>Love: Love here is not a feeling or emotion, but practical action. It
is shown through hospitality, generosity, and care for other
believers.</p>
<p>Faithfulness: Faithfulness means being reliable and trustworthy over
time. It describes steady obedience rather than dramatic moments.</p>
<p>Hospitality: Hospitality is the willing receiving and support of
others, including strangers. In this chapter, it is a primary way truth
and love are expressed.</p>
<p>Fellow Workers: Fellow workers are believers who share in God’s work,
even if they serve in different ways. Supporting faithful servants makes
one a partner in the gospel.</p>
<p>Preeminence: Preeminence is the desire to be first or most important.
In this chapter, it exposes pride and unhealthy leadership.</p>
<p>Testimony: Testimony is the reputation a person’s life creates over
time. It is the evidence others can point to when evaluating character
and faith.</p>
<p>Good and Evil: Good refers to actions that reflect God’s character
and purposes. Evil refers to behavior that harms others and opposes
God’s ways, even when done inside the church.</p>
<p>Leadership and Authority: This chapter contrasts servant leadership
with controlling leadership. True authority supports God’s work, while
unhealthy authority protects position and power.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-chapter-matters">Why This Chapter Matters</h3>
<p>This chapter matters because it shows that faith is not measured by
position, influence, or visibility, but by obedience, humility, and
love. It teaches believers how to recognize healthy and unhealthy
leadership and reminds the church that faithful support of God’s work is
genuine participation in the gospel.</p>
<h3 id="high-level-lessons-from-this-chapter">High-Level Lessons from
This Chapter</h3>
<p>Walking in truth must be visible in daily life<br />
Love for believers is proven through action<br />
Faithful support advances God’s work<br />
Pride in leadership damages the church<br />
Believers must choose carefully who they imitate</p>
