<h2
id="reflections-teaching-and-application-points-from-3-john">Reflections
— Teaching and Application Points from 3 John</h2>
<h4 id="truth-is-not-only-believed-it-is-lived">1. Truth Is Not Only
Believed, It Is Lived</h4>
<p>John rejoices not because Gaius believes the truth, but because he
walks in it. Truth that remains only in the mind has not yet done its
work. Real truth reshapes behavior, priorities, and relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br />
Do my daily choices match what I say I believe?</p>
<h4
id="the-greatest-joy-of-spiritual-leaders-is-faithful-living-not-bible-knowledge">2.
The Greatest Joy of Spiritual Leaders Is Faithful Living, Not Bible
Knowledge</h4>
<p>John’s greatest joy is not that his spiritual children understand
doctrine, but that they live it out. Knowledge without obedience does
not bring lasting joy to mature leaders.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br />
Am I growing in obedience, or only in information?</p>
<h4 id="spiritual-prosperity-must-come-before-physical-prosperity">3.
Spiritual Prosperity Must Come Before Physical Prosperity</h4>
<p>John prays for Gaius’s health and well-being, but only in proportion
to the health of his soul. Scripture consistently places inner life
above outward success.</p>
<p>David Guzik said this, “Many Christians would be desperately ill if
their physical health was instantly in the same state as their spiritual
health.”</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br />
If my physical life instantly reflected my spiritual health, what would
it look like?</p>
<h4 id="love-for-people-is-a-mark-of-christian-maturity">4. Love for
People Is a Mark of Christian Maturity</h4>
<p>John’s repeated use of “beloved” reveals his heart. Mature believers
are marked by genuine care and love for people, not impatience or
superiority.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br />
Is my Christianity and Bible truth making me more loving, or merely more
opinionated?</p>
<h4 id="hospitality-is-love-in-action">5. Hospitality Is Love in
Action</h4>
<p>Gaius’s faith is demonstrated through hospitality, especially toward
believers he does not know personally. Love is proven not by intention,
but by action, deeds and not feelings or emotion.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br />
Who has God placed in my path that I am called to receive and serve?</p>
<h4 id="faithfulness-matters-more-than-visibility-or-results">6.
Faithfulness Matters More Than Visibility or Results</h4>
<p>John praises Gaius for simply for being and acting faithfully. God
values and rewards faithfulness and reliability over show and
gifting.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br />
Am I more concerned with being faithful or being noticed?</p>
<h4 id="supporting-gods-work-makes-us-partners-in-it">7. Supporting
God’s Work Makes Us Partners in It</h4>
<p>Those who support missionaries and servants of the gospel become
fellow workers for the truth. Support roles are not secondary roles in
God’s economy.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br />
Do I see support as real ministry, or only what happens up
publically?</p>
<h4 id="pride-is-the-root-of-many-church-conflicts">8. Pride Is the Root
of Many Church Conflicts</h4>
<p>Diotrephes’s behavior flows from one desire: to be first. Pride leads
to control, slander, rejection of authority, and harm to others.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br />
Where might a desire for recognition be influencing my actions? How do I
respond when I am not recognized?</p>
<h4 id="pride-often-reveals-itself-through-speech">9. Pride Often
Reveals Itself Through Speech</h4>
<p>Diotrephes uses malicious and empty talk to undermine others. The
words that come out of our month are often the first outward sign of a
deeper heart problem.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br />
Do my words build up God’s work or quietly tear it down? What is coming
out of my mouth? Complaining or thanksgiving? Edification or
criticism?</p>
<h4 id="authority-that-refuses-accountability-is-dangerous">10.
Authority That Refuses Accountability Is Dangerous</h4>
<p>Diotrephes rejects apostolic authority and punishes those who
disagree. Leadership without accountability inevitably becomes abusive.
Healthy leadership functions under authority.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br />
Am I teachable and accountable, especially when corrected?</p>
<h4 id="one-unhealthy-leader-can-harm-an-entire-church">11. One
Unhealthy Leader Can Harm an Entire Church</h4>
<p>John shows how one domineering individual can disrupt fellowship,
hinder ministry, and create fear. Ignoring such behavior does not
preserve peace; it destroys it.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br />
Do I avoid difficult issues for the sake of comfort, or address them for
the sake of health?</p>
<h4
id="believers-must-choose-carefully-whom-they-imitate-and-follow">12.
Believers Must Choose Carefully Whom They Imitate and Follow</h4>
<p>John explicitly warns against copying evil behavior and urges
imitation of good. Who we allow access to our life, influences our life.
Choose wisely whom you look to as an example.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br />
Whose example am I following, intentionally or unintentionally?</p>
<h4 id="a-good-reputation-must-be-confirmed-by-truth">13. A Good
Reputation Must Be Confirmed by Truth</h4>
<p>Demetrius has a good report from people and from the truth itself.
Popular approval alone is not enough; a life must align with reality and
integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br />
Would the truth itself speak well of my life?</p>
<h4
id="good-works-are-evidence-not-the-basis-of-relationship-with-god">14.
Good Works Are Evidence, Not the Basis, of Relationship with God</h4>
<p>John teaches that doing good reveals our relationship with God, while
persistent evil exposes a lack of true spiritual sight.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br />
What do my consistent actions reveal about my walk with God?</p>
<h4
id="face-to-face-relationship-matters-more-than-written-communication">15.
Face-to-Face Relationship Matters More Than Written Communication</h4>
<p>John chooses not to write everything down, valuing personal
conversation. Wisdom knows the limits of written communication.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br />
Am I using written communication wisely, or hiding behind it?</p>
<h4 id="be-careful-with-words-especially-in-writing-and-media">16. Be
Careful with Words, Especially in Writing and Media</h4>
<p>John’s restraint highlights the dangers of written words including
email, texts, and social media posts. Once out there, they cannot be
taken back.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br />
Do I take time to think and pause before speaking or posting, especially
when emotional?</p>
<h4 id="peace-can-exist-even-in-the-presence-of-conflict">17. Peace Can
Exist Even in the Presence of Conflict</h4>
<p>John ends with peace, even while unresolved issues remain. Peace is
an inner condition rooted from a right relationship with God. True peace
does not come from external circumstances or perfect harmony in all our
relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br />
Am I grounded in God’s peace which passes understanding, or am I
dependent on having to have calm external circumstances?</p>
<h4 id="god-works-through-faithful-individuals-not-just-movements">18.
God Works Through Faithful Individuals, Not Just Movements</h4>
<p>3 John reminds us that God advances His purposes through faithful
individuals like Gaius, not just large platforms or structures.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br />
Am I being faithful where God has placed me, even if it feels
unseen?</p>
<p><strong>19. Authority is Given for a Purpose</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t know the purpose for something you will abuse it. This
is why there is so much abuse of authority. People can and often do
misuse authority.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We can mistakenly think it gives them the freedom to carry out
their own desires and selfish ambitions.</p></li>
<li><p>We might try to use it to obtain more power, wealth, position,
etc.</p></li>
<li><p>It can be used to try and feel in control and feed our ego,
insecurity or for self-protection.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is what we see with Diotrephes. Diotrephes was put in a position
to lead a group of believers. He misused authority to promote himself at
the expense of others which caused contention, division and hurt in the
church.</p>
<p>Authority and position never given to serve one’s self. Authority is
given to serve the one who gave you the authority. In some cases this is
your boss, this is your parents, this is your ministry leader. In doing
so, we serve God.</p>
