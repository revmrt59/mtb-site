<h2 id="chapter-1-word-studies">Chapter 1: Word Studies</h2>
<p>ELDER — (presbuteros, Strong’s G4245)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
From the comparative form of a word meaning older, senior. Built on the
idea of maturity in age, then applied to maturity in standing and
responsibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
An older man, an elder, one recognized as mature and qualified to lead
or represent others. In the church, it becomes a recognized leadership
role, but the root idea still points to maturity.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture in Biblical times (with examples if
relevant)<br />
Elders were community leaders who represented the people, handled
disputes, and preserved communal order. The word carried weight because
older age normally implied wisdom and proven character.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
Spiritual authority is meant to be rooted in maturity and character. In
Scripture, elder leadership is supposed to be shepherding, not
controlling.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance in the verse<br />
In 3 John 1, John calls himself “the elder” to speak as a spiritual
father and trusted overseer. The tone is relational authority, not
self-promotion.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses of the word in other verses (full NKJV text,
transliteration after English word)<br />
1 Peter 5:1<br />
The elders (presbuterous) who are among you I exhort, I who am a fellow
elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of
the glory that will be revealed. (NKJV)</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Acts 20:17<br />
From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders (presbuterous)
of the church. (NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Other relevant insights or comments<br />
John’s self-identification sets the tone for the whole letter. Healthy
authority starts with humility.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>BELOVED — (agapetos, Strong’s G27)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
From agapao, to love with covenant, self-giving love.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
Dearly loved, cherished. Often used as a title of affection and
honor.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture in Biblical times (with examples if
relevant)<br />
Used for close personal relationships. In Christian use it becomes a
marker of family-level affection among believers.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
Christian instruction is meant to be delivered inside love. The gospel
creates a family, not merely an organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance in the verse<br />
John repeatedly calls Gaius “beloved” because his goal is encouragement
and strengthening, even when problems are addressed later.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses in other verses (full NKJV)<br />
Matthew 3:17<br />
And suddenly a voice came from heaven, saying, “This is My beloved
(agapetos) Son, in whom I am well pleased.” (NKJV)</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Romans 12:19<br />
Beloved (agapetoi), do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to
wrath. (NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Other insights<br />
“Beloved” is not sentimental filler. It frames the letter as
shepherding.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>TRUTH — (aletheia, Strong’s G225)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
Built from a prefix meaning not plus a root connected to hiddenness or
forgetfulness. Core idea: not hidden, not concealed.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
Truth, reality, what is true as opposed to what is false or
deceptive.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture in Biblical times<br />
Often contrasted with appearance, illusion, or deception. In John’s
writings, “truth” becomes deeply moral and relational.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
Truth is not only information. It is a lived reality shaped by God’s
character. In Johannine theology, truth is bound up with
Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance in the verse<br />
“Whom I love in truth” means love governed by God’s reality and
integrity. It is love that refuses hypocrisy and refuses lies.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses in other verses (full NKJV)<br />
John 14:6<br />
Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth (aletheia), and the life. No
one comes to the Father except through Me.” (NKJV)</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>John 17:17<br />
Sanctify them by Your truth (aletheia). Your word is truth. (NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Other insights<br />
In 3 John, truth is measurable by conduct. Truth walks.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>PROSPER — (euodoo, Strong’s G2137)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
Eu (good, well) + hodos (way, road). Literally, to have a good journey
or good road.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
To prosper, to succeed, to have favorable progress in one’s
affairs.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture in Biblical times<br />
Used for travel success and by extension successful outcomes in business
or plans.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
Scripture recognizes that God can grant favorable outcomes, but it does
not reduce blessing to money or comfort.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance in the verse<br />
John prays that Gaius would “prosper in all things,” meaning his
practical life would go well, consistent with his spiritual
stability.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses in other verses (full NKJV)<br />
Romans 1:10<br />
Making request if, by some means, now at last I may find a way in the
will of God to come to you. (NKJV)<br />
Note: the idea of being enabled to have a successful journey aligns with
euodoo even where the exact English term varies.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Corinthians 16:2<br />
On the first day of the week let each one of you lay something aside,
storing up as he may prosper (euodootai), that there be no collections
when I come. (NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Other insights<br />
John sets prosperity under the authority of soul health. Inner order
first, outer order second.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>HEALTH — (hugiano, Strong’s G5198)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
From a root meaning sound, whole. Source of English words related to
hygiene.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
To be healthy, to be sound. Can refer to physical health or soundness in
teaching.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture in Biblical times<br />
Used for bodily well-being and for the idea of something being “sound”
or intact.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
God cares about wholeness. Scripture can speak of bodily healing and
also “sound doctrine,” both tied to the idea of what is
healthy.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance in the verse<br />
John prays for physical well-being for Gaius. It is pastoral, not
materialistic.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses in other verses (full NKJV)<br />
Luke 5:31<br />
Jesus answered and said to them, “Those who are well (hugiainontes) have
no need of a physician, but those who are sick.” (NKJV)</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Titus 2:1<br />
But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound (hugiousa)
doctrine. (NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Other insights<br />
This word ties bodily health and doctrinal health to the same basic
idea: soundness.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>SOUL — (psuche, Strong’s G5590)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
Related to breath and life. In common usage, the inner life that
animates the person.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
Soul, life, the inner self, the seat of desire, will, and personal
identity.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture in Biblical times<br />
Used broadly for life itself, and also for the inner person. Scripture
does not treat “soul” as a disposable part of you. It is you on the
inside.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
God saves, sanctifies, and restores the inner person. The soul can
flourish or wither.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance in the verse<br />
John says Gaius’s soul is prospering. That means his inner life is
strong, stable, and aligned with truth.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses in other verses (full NKJV)<br />
Matthew 16:26<br />
For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses
his own soul (psuchen)? Or what will a man give in exchange for his
soul? (NKJV)</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>3 John 2<br />
Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health,
just as your soul (psuche) prospers. (NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Other insights<br />
John measures life from the inside out. That is a foundational biblical
lens.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>PROSPERS — (euodoo, Strong’s G2137)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
Same as prosper above, good way, good progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
Ongoing favorable progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture<br />
Often used as a present or continuing condition.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
Healthy spirituality is not a one-time event. It is sustained
progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance<br />
John assumes Gaius’s soul is actively thriving, not merely
surviving.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses (full NKJV)<br />
1 Corinthians 16:2<br />
On the first day of the week let each one of you lay something aside,
storing up as he may prosper (euodootai), that there be no collections
when I come. (NKJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Other insights<br />
John’s prayer is alignment: outward prosperity matching inward
prosperity.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>WALK — (peripateo, Strong’s G4043)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
Peri (around) + pateo (to walk, step). To walk about. Figuratively, to
live and conduct oneself.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
To live, to behave, to order one’s life.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture<br />
Common metaphor for lifestyle and conduct.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
Christianity is a way of life, not a claim. Walking is obedience over
time.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance<br />
“Walk in the truth” means truth governs choices, relationships, speech,
and priorities.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses (full NKJV)<br />
Ephesians 4:1<br />
I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you to walk
(peripatesai) worthy of the calling with which you were called.
(NKJV)</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>1 John 1:7<br />
But if we walk (peripatomen) in the light as He is in the light, we have
fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son
cleanses us from all sin. (NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Other insights<br />
In 3 John, walk is the evidence that “truth is in you.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>JOY — (chara, Strong’s G5479)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
Related to charis, grace. Joy is often tied to grace as its
source.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
Joy, deep gladness, a settled delight.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture<br />
Could be used for ordinary happiness, but in Scripture often becomes joy
grounded in God.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
Joy is not dependent on circumstances. It is rooted in God’s work and
God’s faithfulness.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance<br />
John’s greatest joy is not comfort, influence, or control. It is
believers walking in truth.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses (full NKJV)<br />
John 15:11<br />
These things I have spoken to you, that My joy (chara) may remain in
you, and that your joy may be full. (NKJV)</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Galatians 5:22<br />
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy (chara), peace, longsuffering,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness. (NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Other insights<br />
John’s joy is pastoral joy, the joy of seeing truth become
life.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>FAITHFULLY — (pistos, Strong’s G4103)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
From peitho, to persuade, to be convinced. It moves toward trustworthy
reliability.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
Faithful, trustworthy, dependable. Can describe belief and also
reliability.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture<br />
Used for dependable persons and reliable commitments.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
Faith is proven through faithfulness. Trust in God produces reliability
in life.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance<br />
Gaius acts faithfully in how he serves believers and strangers. His
faith shows up as dependable action.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses (full NKJV)<br />
1 Corinthians 4:2<br />
Moreover it is required in stewards that one be found faithful (pistos).
(NKJV)</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Revelation 2:10<br />
Be faithful (pistos) until death, and I will give you the crown of life.
(NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Other insights<br />
John praises reliability, not flash. That is a core discipleship
value.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>BORNE — (martureo, Strong’s G3140)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
Related to martus, witness. Root idea is public attestation.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
To bear witness, to testify, to speak as a witness.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture<br />
Used in legal settings and public testimony. A witness is someone who
speaks what they know.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
Christianity is a testimony faith. God gives witnesses, and believers
become witnesses.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance<br />
People testify about Gaius’s love. His life creates credible witness in
the community.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses (full NKJV)<br />
John 1:7<br />
This man came for a witness, to bear witness (marturesē) of the Light,
that all through him might believe. (NKJV)</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Acts 1:8<br />
But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and
you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria,
and to the end of the earth. (NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Other insights<br />
In 3 John, witness is not merely preaching. It is reputation formed by
integrity.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>WITNESS — (marturia, Strong’s G3141)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
From the same family as martureo, testimony language.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
Testimony, witness, evidence given by a witness.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture<br />
Formal testimony, evidence, affirmation.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
The gospel comes with testimony: God’s testimony about His Son, and the
church’s testimony about transformed lives.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance<br />
The church hears testimony about Gaius’s love and truth-walk. This
strengthens unity and discernment.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses (full NKJV)<br />
1 John 5:11<br />
And this is the testimony (marturia): that God has given us eternal
life, and this life is in His Son. (NKJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Other insights<br />
Testimony functions like spiritual evidence. It helps the church
recognize what is real.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>LOVE — (agape, Strong’s G26)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
Related to agapao. In Scripture, defined by God’s action, not merely
emotion.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
Self-giving, covenant love that seeks the good of another.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture<br />
Less common than other Greek words for love, but in Christian use it
becomes central and richly defined.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
God is love. Love is the mark of genuine discipleship.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance<br />
Gaius’s love is expressed as hospitality and support. Love becomes
visible action.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses (full NKJV)<br />
John 13:35<br />
By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love
(agapēn) for one another. (NKJV)</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Corinthians 13:4<br />
Love (agapē) suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not
parade itself, is not puffed up. (NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Other insights<br />
In 3 John, love supports truth. Love does not replace truth.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>GENTILES — (ethnos, Strong’s G1484)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
Ethnos refers to a people group, nation, a body of persons bound
together.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
Nations, Gentiles, those outside Israel in Jewish usage, often meaning
non-believers in a given context.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture<br />
Neutral term for nations. In Jewish and early Christian contexts, often
used to distinguish those outside covenant community.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
The gospel goes to the nations, but the church maintains integrity in
how the message is supported and presented.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance<br />
The traveling workers took nothing from the Gentiles, meaning they did
not finance gospel mission by leaning on unbelievers.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses (full NKJV)<br />
Matthew 28:19<br />
Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations (ethnē), baptizing
them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
(NKJV)</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Romans 1:16<br />
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God
to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for
the Greek. (NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Other insights<br />
John’s point is about spiritual credibility. The mission should not be
compromised by wrong dependencies.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>FELLOW WORKERS — (sunergos, Strong’s G4904)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
Sun (with) + ergon (work). Co-laborer.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
A partner in labor, a co-worker in the work of God.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture<br />
Common term for collaborators in a shared task.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
God’s work is shared. Support is participation. Partnership is real
ministry.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance<br />
Those who receive and support faithful workers become fellow workers for
the truth. Hospitality becomes ministry.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses (full NKJV)<br />
Philippians 4:3<br />
And I urge you also, true companion, help these women who labored with
me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers
(sunergōn), whose names are in the Book of Life. (NKJV)</p></li>

<li><p>Other insights<br />
This destroys the false division between “front-line” ministry and
“support” ministry.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>PREEMINENCE — (philoproteuo, Strong’s G5383)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
Phileo (to love) + proteuo (to be first). To love being first.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
To desire to be first, to insist on primacy, to crave
prominence.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture<br />
The pursuit of honor-status was normal in the ancient world. John
exposes it as spiritually dangerous.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
Pride is a direct rival to Christ’s lordship. When a leader must be
first, Christ is pushed aside.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance<br />
Diotrephes loves preeminence among them. This explains his refusal to
receive others and his harsh control.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses (full NKJV)<br />
Mark 9:35<br />
And He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, “If anyone desires
to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all.”
(NKJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Other insights<br />
The letter shows how “being first” becomes practical harm, not merely an
attitude.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>RECEIVE — (epidechomai, Strong’s G1926)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
Epi (upon) + dechomai (to receive, welcome). To receive favorably, to
welcome.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
To welcome, accept, receive with openness.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture<br />
Welcoming guests was an honor-based social duty. In the church it
becomes a spiritual practice.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
Receiving the brethren is receiving Christ’s work. Refusing them can be
refusing what God is doing.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance<br />
Diotrephes does not receive apostolic representatives or faithful
brethren. His refusal is a spiritual symptom.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses (full NKJV)<br />
Matthew 10:40<br />
He who receives (dechetai) you receives Me, and he who receives Me
receives Him who sent Me. (NKJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Other insights<br />
Hospitality and reception are spiritual discernment issues, not merely
social manners.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>DEEDS — (ergon, Strong’s G2041)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />

Works, deeds, what someone does in practice.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture<br />
Used for labor and outcomes, what a person produces.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
Deeds reveal the heart. Salvation is by grace, but behavior exposes what
rules a person.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance<br />
John will “call to mind his deeds.” The issue is observable actions, not
rumors.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses (full NKJV)<br />
James 2:17<br />
Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works (erga), is dead.
(NKJV)</p></li>

I know your works (erga), your labor, your patience, and that you cannot
bear those who are evil. (NKJV)</p>

<li><p>Other insights<br />
John is not nitpicking. He is dealing with patterns of destructive
leadership behavior.</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />

harm.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture<br />
Used for foolish speech, gossip, idle chatter, the kind of talk that

<li><p>Theological implications<br />
Words can become weapons. False speech is fellowship-breaking. Scripture
treats destructive talk as a serious sin.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance<br />
Diotrephes is not merely disagreeing. He is running his mouth in a way
that damages people and undermines authority.</p></li>

lips is wise. (NKJV)</p></li>

To speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility
to all men. (NKJV)</p>

Pride often expresses itself first in speech, then in control.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>MALICIOUS — (poneros, Strong’s G4190)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
Word can mean evil in a morally active, harmful sense.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
Evil, wicked, harmful, morally corrupt, and often actively
damaging.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture<br />

<li><p>Theological implications<br />
Evil is not just “mistakes.” It can be a chosen posture that harms
others and opposes God.</p></li>

“Malicious words” are words with harmful intent, designed to tear
down.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses (full NKJV)<br />

And do not lead us into temptation, But deliver us from the evil one
(ponērou). For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.
Amen. (NKJV)</p></li>

Above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to
quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one (ponērou). (NKJV)</p>

copy.</p></li>

Romans 12:21<br />
Do not be overcome by evil (kakō), but overcome evil with good.
(NKJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Other insights<br />
“Do not imitate evil” means do not copy the methods, not just avoid the
outcomes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>GOOD — (agathos, Strong’s G18)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
Word for intrinsic goodness, beneficial goodness.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
Good, upright, beneficial, what aligns with what is right.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture<br />

<li><p>Theological implications<br />
Goodness is a reflection of God’s character. It is not merely niceness.
It is righteousness expressed in life.</p></li>

God-likeness.</p></li>

For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good (agathon)
dwells; for to will is present with me, but how to perform what is good
I do not find. (NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Other insights<br />
John’s “good” is not vague. It is goodness expressed in actions like
hospitality, truth-walking, and humility.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>TESTIMONY — (marturia, Strong’s G3141)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Greek roots / derivation<br />
From the witness word-family (martus, martureo). Carries the idea of
evidence given by a witness.</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning / definition<br />
Testimony, witness, confirmed report.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage in Greek culture<br />
Legal and public contexts. A testimony establishes what is
credible.</p></li>
<li><p>Theological implications<br />
Christianity rests on witness: God’s witness about His Son, apostolic
witness, and the church’s witness in changed lives.</p></li>
<li><p>Contextual nuance<br />
Demetrius has testimony from all, from the truth itself, and from
apostolic confirmation. This is layered credibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Key uses (full NKJV)<br />
