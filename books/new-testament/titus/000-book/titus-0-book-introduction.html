<h2 id="introduction-to-titus"><strong>Introduction to Titus</strong></h2>
<h3 id="historical-cultural-and-pastoral-context">Historical, Cultural, and Pastoral Context</h3>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The letter to Titus was written by the apostle Paul to a trusted co-worker whom he left in Crete to complete unfinished work among newly established churches. Paul states the purpose of the letter clearly.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Titus 1:5</strong> <em>For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking, and appoint elders in every city as I commanded you</em>—(NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>From the beginning, the letter is concerned with order, leadership, and church health. Paul is not addressing a lack of enthusiasm or profession of faith. The churches existed, but they were immature and unhealthy. What was missing was structure, qualified leadership, spiritual maturity, and stability. Paul writes so that the gospel would take firm root and shape real life.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="titus-role-and-authority">Titus— Role and Authority</h3>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Titus is not addressed as a local pastor acting independently. He functions as Paul—s apostolic delegate, carrying authority that flows from Paul—s commission.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Titus 1:4</strong> <em>To Titus, a true son in our common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</em> (NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The New Testament shows Titus as a close and trusted companion of Paul. He appears in difficult situations that required wisdom, firmness, and courage (Galatians 2:1—3; 2 Corinthians 7:6—7). This background shows that Titus was seasoned and reliable. The instructions in this letter carry apostolic authority and are meant to be obeyed, not treated as personal advice.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="cultural-context-crete">Cultural Context: Crete</h3>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The churches in Crete likely began soon after Pentecost, when Cretans who were present in Jerusalem carried the gospel back home (Acts 2:11). These churches developed within a culture that did not value moral discipline, truthfulness, or restraint, and they developed without strong leadership in place.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Paul describes the cultural environment directly.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><span data-custom-style="MTB Scripture Block Char"><strong>Titus 1:12—13</strong> “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” This testimony is true. (NKJV</span>)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Paul is not offering cultural commentary for its own sake. He is being realistic. The surrounding culture was shaping the churches more than the churches were shaping the culture. This explains why the letter repeatedly emphasizes self-control, integrity, and conduct that visibly matches the gospel (Titus 2:1—10; 3:1—2).</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p><strong><u>The Internal Problem Facing the Churches</u></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Paul—s primary concern is not external opposition but internal disorder.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><span data-custom-style="MTB Scripture Block Char"><strong>Titus 1:10—11</strong> For there are many insubordinate, both idle talkers and deceiversΓÇª whose mouths must be stoppedΓÇª (NKJV</span>)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>False teaching, selfish motives, and lack of restraint were damaging households and weakening the church from within.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Titus 1:16</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">They profess to know God, but in works they deny HimΓÇª</span> (NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This contrast between what people claim and how they live frames the entire letter.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p><strong><u>Healthy Biblical Teaching as Foundational</u></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Paul repeatedly ties truth to life. Doctrine is never treated as abstract belief. Truth is meant to be lived.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Titus 1:1</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">ΓÇªthe acknowledgment of the truth which accords with godliness.</span> (NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Throughout the letter, Paul stresses sound, or healthy, doctrine.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Titus 1:9</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">ΓÇªholding fast the faithful word as he has been taughtΓÇª</span> (NKJV)<br />
<span data-custom-style="Strong">Titus 1:13</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">ΓÇªthat they may be sound in the faith.</span> (NKJV)<br />
<span data-custom-style="Strong">Titus 2:1</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine.</span> (NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Healthy teaching produces healthy lives.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p><strong><u>Leadership as the Means of Preservation</u></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Paul begins with elders because leadership shapes the life of the church.</p>
</div>
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Titus 1:7—9</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">For a bishop must be blamelessΓÇª holding fast the faithful wordΓÇª</span> (NKJV)</p>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Leaders are responsible first to live godly lives and then to protect and teach the truth. When leadership fails, the church becomes vulnerable.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Grace and Godly Living</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Grace is central in Titus, not only as the basis of salvation, but as the power for a changed life.</p>
</div>
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Titus 2:11—12</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men, teaching us thatΓÇª we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age.</span> (NKJV)</p>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Grace does not merely forgive. Grace teaches and enables. What God commands, His grace provides. Godly living flows from grace received, not pressure applied.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p><strong><u>Good Works as the Visible Fruit of Faith</u></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>One of the clearest emphases in Titus is the repeated call to good works as the outcome of genuine faith.</p>
</div>
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Titus 1:16</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">ΓÇªdisqualified for every good work.</span> (NKJV)<br />
<span data-custom-style="Strong">Titus 2:7</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">ΓÇªshowing yourself to be a pattern of good worksΓÇª</span> (NKJV)<br />
<span data-custom-style="Strong">Titus 2:14</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">ΓÇªzealous for good works.</span> (NKJV)<br />
<span data-custom-style="Strong">Titus 3:8</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">ΓÇªcareful to maintain good worksΓÇª</span> (NKJV)</p>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Good works do not earn salvation. They show that salvation is real.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Context Summary</p>

<div class="MTB-Explain">
