<p><em><strong>THE PASTORAL EPISTLES</strong></em></p>
<ol type="I">
<li><p><strong>Name: Pastoral Epistles<br />
</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>The name given to three letters of the apostle Paul: 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Pastoral Epistles are distinguished from Paul—s other ten books</p></li>
<li><p>Among the last letters Paul wrote - reflect concern of one who is nearing the end of his ministry and life</p></li>
<li><p>Addressed to men and not a congregation</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Pastoral Epistles</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Titus 1:4</strong> <em>to Titus, my true child in a common faith: ΓÇª</em> NAS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 1:2</strong> <em>to Timothy, my true child in the faith:ΓÇª</em> NAS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 1:2</strong> <em>to Timothy, my beloved son: ΓÇª</em>NAS</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>1Cor 1:1-2 Paul, ΓÇªUnto the church of God which is at CorinthΓÇª (KJV)</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>They are called the pastoral epistles because:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Paul wrote them to two Christian ministers — Timothy and Titus</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>When Timothy and Titus received these epistles they were not acting, as they had previously done, as missionaries or itinerant evangelists, but had been left by Paul in charge of churches.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Timothy was left having the oversight of the church in Ephesus</p></li>
<li><p>Titus was left having the care of the churches in the island of Crete.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The Pastoral Epistles were written to guide them in the discharge of the duties devolving upon them as Christian pastors.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>They clearly show Paul's love and concern as pastor and administrator of several local churches.</p></li>
<li><p>They contain instructions concerning the church</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Called Pastoral because they seem to be addressed to Pastors of churches and contain instruction for pastoral work in the churches</p>

</ol></li>

<li><p>What should I teach people? Sound doctrine Titus 2</p></li>
<li><p>What about prayer? 1Tim 2</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Their Order<br />
</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>The order in which they were written must have been 1 Timothy, Titus, 2 Timothy.</p></li>
<li><p>It is universally acknowledged that 2 Timothy is the very last of Paul's extant epistles, and the internal evidence of the other two seems to point out 1 Timothy as earlier than Titus.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Date<br />
</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>The general consensus is that following his first imprisonment in Rome the apostle Paul was released and allowed to travel for several years before being arrested again. The following itinerary has been proposed by the Ryrie Study Bible:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Paul was released from his house arrest in Rome (where we find him at the end of Acts), probably because his accusers did not choose to press their charges against him before Caesar (Ac 24:1; 28:30).Their case, therefore, was lost by default, and Paul was freed.</p></li>
<li><p>Paul visited Ephesus, left Timothy there to supervise the churches, and went on to Macedonia (northern Greece).</p></li>
<li><p>From there he wrote 1 Timothy (1 Ti 1:3).</p></li>
<li><p>He visited Crete, left Titus there to supervise those churches, and went to Nicopolis in Achaia (southern Greece, Ti 3:12).</p></li>
<li><p>Either from Macedonia or Nicopolis, he wrote this letter to encourage Titus.</p></li>
<li><p>He visited Troas (2 Ti 4:13), where he was suddenly arrested, taken to Rome, imprisoned, and finally beheaded.</p></li>
<li><p>From Rome, during this second imprisonment, he wrote 2 Timothy.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Executable Outline</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Paul was in Roman prison for two years (AD 60-62) [Act 28:16]. During this time he wrote the prison epistles.</p></li>
<li><p>Probably released in AD 62 to which he visited the Asian Minor and Macedonian churches, including Crete, where he left Titus behind to carry in the work (Tit 1:5)</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Paul wrote 1Timothy and Titus at some point while traveling.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>In AD 63 or 64, Paul went to Spain and then returned to Greece and Asia Minor before going back to Rome.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>There occurred a visit to Miletus where Trophimus was left sick (2 Tim 4:20)</p></li>
<li><p>A visit to Troas where cloak and parchments were left (2Tim 4:13)</p></li>
<li><p>And perhaps a visit to Corinth (2Tim 4:20), as these cities form a natural route to Rome.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Paul was imprisoned for a second time in Rome (2Tim 1:16-17)</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Nero had placed the blame for the burning of Rome on the Christians and so Christianity was probably now an illegal religion</p></li>
<li><p>Paul was arrested and expected to be executed</p></li>
<li><p>During this imprisonment he wrote 2Timothy.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Paul was executed between AD64-67 (date is uncertain)</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Summary of Theme (Nelson—s)<br />
</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>The purpose of the pastoral epistles is to admonish, instruct, and direct the recipients in their pastoral duties.</p></li>
<li><p>These letters deal with the care and the organization of the church, the flock of God.</p></li>
<li><p>They contain common injunctions to guard the Christian faith, to appoint qualified officials, to conduct proper worship, and to maintain discipline both personally and in the churches.</p></li>
<li><p>They give instructions in the work of the church and show how threats to the doctrinal and moral purity of Christians should be overcome.</p></li>
