<p><em><strong>TITUS</strong></em></p>
<ol type="I">
<li><p><strong>Author<br />
</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>The apostle Paul, as stated in the salutation (1:1).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Titus 1:1</strong> <em>Paul, a bond-servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,</em> NAS</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The testimony of church history also provides overwhelming support that Paul is the author.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Recipient</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Titus</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Titus 1:4</strong> <em>to Titus, my true child in a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.</em> NAS</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Titus - (pleasant)-a "partner and fellow worker" (2 Cor 8:23) of the apostle Paul.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Titus is not mentioned in the Book of Acts.</p></li>
<li><p>Paul's letters reveal that he was the man of the hour at a number of key points in Paul's life.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Paul first mentions Titus in Gal 2:1-3.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Galatians 2:1-3</strong> <em>Then after an interval of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also. 2 And it was because of a revelation that I went up; and I submitted to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but I did so in private to those who were of reputation, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain. 3 But not even Titus who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.</em> NAS</p></li>
<li><p>As an uncircumcised Gentile, Titus accompanied Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem as a living example of a great theological truth: Gentiles need not be circumcised in order to be saved.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Titus next appears in connection with Paul's mission to Corinth.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>While Paul was in Ephesus during his third missionary journey, he received disturbing news from the church at Corinth.</p></li>
<li><p>After writing two letters and paying one visit to Corinth, Paul sent Titus to Corinth with a third letter (2 Cor 7:6-9).</p></li>
<li><p>When Titus failed to return with news of the situation, Paul left Ephesus and, with a troubled spirit (2 Cor 7:5), traveled north to Troas (2 Cor 2:12-13).</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, in Macedonia, Titus met the anxious apostle with the good news that the church at Corinth had repented. In relief and joy, Paul wrote yet another letter to Corinth (2 Cor), perhaps from Philippi, sending it again through Titus (2 Cor 7:5-16).</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, Titus was given responsibility for completing the collection for the poor of Jerusalem (2 Cor 8:6,16-24; 12:18).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Titus appears in another important role on the island of Crete (Titus 1:4).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Beset by a rise in false teaching and declining morality, Titus was told by Paul to strengthen the churches by teaching sound doctrine and good works, and by appointing elders in every city (Titus 1:5).</p></li>
<li><p>Paul then urged Titus to join him in Nicopolis (on the west coast of Greece) for winter (Titus 3:12). Not surprisingly, Titus was remembered in church tradition as the first bishop of Crete.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>A final reference to Titus comes from 2 Tim 4:10, where Paul remarks in passing that Titus has departed for mission work in Dalmatia (modern Yugoslavia).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Titus was a man for the tough tasks. According to Paul</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>He was dependable</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>2 Corinthians 8:17</strong> <em>For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest, he has gone to you of his own accord.</em> NAS</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Reliable</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>2 Corinthians 7:6</strong> <em>But God, who comforts the depressed, comforted us by the coming of Titus;</em> NAS</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Diligent</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>2 Corinthians 8:17</strong> <em>For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest, he has gone to you of his own accord.</em> NAS</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>He had a great capacity for human affection</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>2 Corinthians 7:13-15</strong> <em>For this reason we have been comforted. And besides our comfort, we rejoiced even much more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all. 14 For if in anything I have boasted to him about you, I was not put to shame; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, so also our boasting before Titus proved to be the truth. 15 And his affection abounds all the more toward you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.</em> NAS</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>He must have been a good organizer because Paul left him in Crete to complete the unfinished tasks</p></li>
<li><p>He must have been a teacher (duties in Crete)</p></li>
<li><p>Strong-enough to deal with conflict (duties in Crete)</p></li>
<li><p>Possessing both strength and tact, Titus calmed a desperate situation on more than one occasion. He is a good model for Christians who are called to live out their witness in trying circumstances.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>In Crete</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Titus remained and received a letter written to him by the apostle.</p></li>
<li><p>From this letter we learn that Titus was originally converted through Paul's instrumentality (v. 4).</p></li>
<li><p>Next we learn the various particulars of the responsible duties that he had to discharge in Crete.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>He was to complete what Paul had been obliged to leave unfinished (v. 5)</p></li>
<li><p>To organize the church throughout the island by appointing presbyters in every city.</p></li>
<li><p>Next he was to control and silence (v. 11) the restless and mischievous Judaizers, and he was to be peremptory in so doing (v. 13).</p></li>
<li><p>He was to urge the duties of a decorous and Christian life upon the women (2:3-5), some of whom, possibly, had something of an official character (vv. 3-4).</p></li>
<li><p>Titus was to look for the arrival in Crete of Artemas and Tychicus (3:12), and then he was to hasten to join Paul at Nicopolis, where the apostle was proposing to pass the winter. Zenas and Apollos were in Crete, or expected there, for Titus was to send them on their journey and supply them with whatever they needed for it (v. 13).</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong><br />
Time and Place of Writing<br />
</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>The general consensus is that following his first imprisonment in Rome the apostle Paul was released and allowed to travel for several years before being arrested again. The following itinerary has been proposed by the Ryrie Study Bible:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Paul was released from his house arrest in Rome (where we find him at the end of Acts), probably because his accusers did not choose to press their charges against him before Caesar (Ac 24:1; 28:30).Their case, therefore, was lost by default, and Paul was freed.</p></li>
<li><p>Paul visited Ephesus, left Timothy there to supervise the churches, and went on to Macedonia (northern Greece).</p></li>
<li><p>From there he wrote 1 Timothy (1 Ti 1:3).</p></li>
<li><p>He visited Crete, left Titus there to supervise those churches, and went to Nicopolis in Achaia (southern Greece, Ti 3:12).</p></li>
<li><p>Either from Macedonia or Nicopolis, he wrote this letter to encourage Titus.</p></li>
<li><p>He visited Troas (2 Ti 4:13), where he was suddenly arrested, taken to Rome, imprisoned, and finally beheaded.</p></li>
<li><p>From Rome, during this second imprisonment, he wrote 2 Timothy.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>It cannot be established with certainty, but it possible that Paul wrote this letter from Corinth, sometime around 63-66 A.D.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Purpose<br />
</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p><strong>Titus 1:5</strong> <em>For this reason I left you in Crete, <u>that you might set in order what remains</u>, …,</em> NAS</p></li>
<li><p>Like his first epistle to Timothy, this letter is written to a young preacher assigned a difficult task. Evidently the churches on the island of Crete were in need of maturation, and this letter is designed to assist Titus in that work. Therefore, Paul wrote to encourage Titus:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>To see that qualified elders were appointed in every city (1:5-9)</p></li>
<li><p>To preach things befitting "sound doctrine" (2:1)</p></li>
<li><p>To exhort the brethren to be "zealous for good works" (2:14; 3:1,8,14)</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Theme<br />
</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>The key phrase in this epistle is "good works" (1:16; 2:7,14; 3:1,8,14). An appropriate theme for this epistle might therefore be: "MAINTAIN GOOD WORKS!"</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Verses<br />
</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p><strong>Titus 1:5</strong> <em>For this reason I left you in Crete, that you might set in order what remains, and appoint elders in every city as I directed you,</em> NAS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Titus 2:11-14</strong> <em>For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, 12 instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age, 13 looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus; 14 who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.</em> NAS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Titus 3:8</strong> <em>This is a trustworthy statement; and concerning these things I want you to speak confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and profitable for men.</em> NAS</p></li>

<li><p>See</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>To review the qualifications for elders in the church</p></li>
<li><p>To examine the work of elders related to the Word of God</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>SUMMARY</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Paul begins by identifying himself as a servant and an apostle whose service is according to the faith of God's chosen people and the truth which is according to godliness. It is also in hope of the eternal life promised by God before time began, and whose word is now being manifested through preaching. He then greets Titus as his "true son in the common faith", bestowing upon him grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Jesus our Savior (1-4).</p></li>
<li><p>Paul quickly addresses the reason he left Titus in Crete, to set in order what things were lacking and to appoint elders in every city. To assist him in that task, Paul reviews the qualifications necessary for those who would be appointed as elders (5-9).</p></li>
<li><p>The last qualification for elders (being able to convict those who contradict) leads right into the final section of this chapter, in which Titus is told to sharply rebuke those of the circumcision who through insubordination and deceit had been subverting entire households, acting just like the characterization made by one of the ancient Cretan prophets. Motivated by dishonest gain, giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men, they became defiled even in their mind and conscience. These false teachers may have professed to know God, but by their works they denied Him and proved themselves unfit for every good work (10-16).</p></li>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>To note the various instructions pertaining to proper Christian conduct</p></li>
<li><p>To observe how the grace of God does not give us license to sin, but is designed to produce sober, righteous, and godly lives</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Summary</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Having reviewed the qualifications of elders and their work, Paul exhorts Titus to "speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine." Such things include the proper conduct expected of Christians, both male and female, young and old, and of those who are servants. Even Titus was to present himself as a pattern of good works for others to follow, which would also serve to silence any opponents of the faith (1-10).</p></li>
<li><p>Paul then writes of the grace of God that brings salvation to all men. This wonderful grace instructs us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, choosing instead to live soberly, righteously and godly. It also encourages us to look forward to the blessed hope we have related to the glorious appearing of Jesus Christ, who gave Himself to redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself a special people who are zealous for good works. These things Titus was to teach with all authority, allowing none to despise him for doing so (11-15).</p></li>

<li><p>To consider how one is saved by God's mercy, through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit</p></li>
<li><p>To notice the emphasis on being careful to maintain good works, while avoiding things that are unprofitable and useless (including some individuals)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>SUMMARY</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>In this final chapter Paul instructs Titus to remind the brethren concerning their duties toward those in authority and men in general (1-2). Exhortations to gentleness and humility toward all men is made with a reminder that we too were once like those in the world (3). We have been saved, not by our own works of righteousness, but by the mercy of God who saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit (4-5). The Spirit has been poured out abundantly on us, so that we who are justified might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life (6-7). Paul also wants Titus to affirm constantly that those who have believed in God should be diligent in their good works (8). At the same time, foolish disputes and divisive men are to be avoided, for such are unprofitable and useless (9-11).</p></li>
<li><p>The epistle closes with personal remarks and greetings. Titus is encouraged to come to Nicopolis as soon as Artemas or Tychicus have arrived, for Paul has chosen to winter there (12). In the meantime, Titus is to send Zenas and Apollos on their journey with haste (13). Yet another exhortation is given to have the brethren learn to maintain good works, meeting urgent needs, so they may not be unfruitful. Paul then passes along greetings to Titus from those with him, and sends similar greetings to those who love the brethren (13-14). A final benediction regarding grace ends the letter (15).</p></li>
