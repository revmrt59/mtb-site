<h2 id="paul-establishes-titus-authority-in-crete-titus-114">1. Paul Establishes Titus— Authority in Crete (Titus 1:1—4)</h2>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p>Titus 1:1-4 Paul, a bondservant (G1401) of God and an apostle (G652) of Jesus Christ, according to the faith (G4102) of God—s elect (G1588) and the acknowledgment of the truth which accords with godliness (G2150), 2 in hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised (G1861) before time began, 3 but has in due time manifested His word through preaching (G2782), which was committed to me according to the commandment (G2003) of God our Savior; 4 To Titus, a true son in our common faith (G4102): Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul opens the letter by explaining who he is and why he has the right to speak. He calls himself a <span data-custom-style="Strong">bondservant of God</span> and an <span data-custom-style="Strong">apostle of Jesus Christ</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>A <span data-custom-style="Strong">bondservant</span> is someone who belongs to another. Paul is saying his life and work belong to God. He does not speak for himself or act on personal preference.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>An <span data-custom-style="Strong">apostle</span> is someone sent with authority to represent another. Paul is saying he was sent by Jesus Christ to speak on His behalf. What he writes carries weight because it comes from a commission, not from opinion.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul then explains what his work is meant to accomplish. His ministry serves <span data-custom-style="Strong">the faith of God—s people</span> and <span data-custom-style="Strong">their understanding of the truth</span>. This truth is not just information. It is truth that leads to <span data-custom-style="Strong">godliness</span>, meaning a life that reflects obedience and reverence toward God. If belief does not show up in how people live, it has missed its purpose.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul connects this truth and godly living to <span data-custom-style="Strong">hope</span>, specifically the hope of <span data-custom-style="Strong">eternal life</span>. This hope is dependable because it rests on God, who <span data-custom-style="Strong">cannot lie</span>. What believers are trusting in is secure, not because people are faithful, but because of who God is.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>He then says this eternal life was <span data-custom-style="Strong">promised before time began</span>. In other words, the gospel is not a reaction to human failure. It was part of God—s eternal purpose before history started.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul explains how that promise became known. God made His word clear <span data-custom-style="Strong">through preaching</span>, and Paul says this message was <span data-custom-style="Strong">entrusted to him</span>. He speaks because God commanded him to do so. He is responsible to deliver the message, not reshape it.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Only after establishing all of this does Paul address Titus. He calls him a <span data-custom-style="Strong">true son in a shared faith</span>. Titus is not acting independently. He stands in the same faith and under the same truth Paul has described.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul closes with a blessing of <span data-custom-style="Strong">grace, mercy, and peace</span> from God the Father and Jesus Christ our Savior. That blessing matters because the work ahead will be demanding, and it will require God—s help, not just effort.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Together, these opening verses establish that:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>authority comes from God, not personality,</p>

<h2 id="why-titus-was-left-in-crete-and-what-was-lacking-titus-15">2. Why Titus Was Left in Crete and What Was Lacking (Titus 1:5)</h2>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><span data-custom-style="Emphasis"><em>Titus 1:5</em></span></p>
</div>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><span data-custom-style="Emphasis"><em>“For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking (G3007), and appoint (G2525) elders (G4245) in every city as I commanded yo—”</em></span> <span data-custom-style="Strong">(NKJV)</span></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul now tells Titus why he is in Crete. Titus is not there by chance. Paul says, “For this reason I left you in Crete.” He stayed behind on purpose.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>The churches in Crete already existed, but they were unfinished. That is what Paul means by <span data-custom-style="Strong">“the things that are lacking.”</span> Something had started, but it was not yet put together the way it needed to be.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>To <span data-custom-style="Strong">“set in order”</span> means to straighten what is incomplete or out of place. Paul is saying the gospel had taken root, but without structure it would not last. Truth needs support if it is going to shape people—s lives over time.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul then says what that support looks like: <span data-custom-style="Strong">“appoint elders in every city.”</span> Elders are leaders who guard teaching, set an example, and care for the church. Paul does not treat this as optional. Where there is a church, there must be leadership.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>The phrase <span data-custom-style="Strong">“in every city”</span> shows this was meant to be normal, not selective. Every local church needed faithful oversight.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul ends by saying, <span data-custom-style="Strong">“as I commanded you.”</span> Titus is not inventing this. He is carrying out what has already been given. His authority comes from obedience, not personality.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>This verse moves the letter from foundation to action. What Paul described in verses 1—4 now has to take shape in real churches, with real leaders, in real places.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Of foundational importance, each church is to be locally governed by a plurality of qualified elders. Shared oversight provides accountability, balance, and protection for the body</p>

<h2 id="gods-design-for-church-leadership-qualified-elders-titus-169">3. God—s Design for Church Leadership: Qualified Elders (Titus 1:6—9)</h2>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><strong>Titus 1:6-9</strong> if a man is blameless (G410), the husband of one wife, having faithful (G4103) children not accused of dissipation or insubordination. 7 For a bishop must be blameless (G410), as a steward (G3623) of God, not self-willed (G829), not quick (G3711)-tempered, not given to wine (G3943), not violent, not greedy (G150) for money, 8 but hospitable (G5382), a lover of what is good (G5358) (G18), sober (G4998)-minded, just (G1342), holy (G3741), self-controlled (G1468), 9 holding fast (G472) the faithful (G4103) word as he has been taught, that he may be able (G1415), by sound (G1517) doctrine (G1319), both to exhort (G3870) and convict (G1651) those who contradict. (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>In these verses, Paul explains what kind of men Titus is to appoint as elders. He does not focus on skills, charisma, or public ability. He focuses on <span data-custom-style="Strong">character</span>, <span data-custom-style="Strong">home life</span>, and <span data-custom-style="Strong">faithfulness to the truth</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>An elder must be <span data-custom-style="Strong">blameless</span>. This does not mean sinless. It means there is no ongoing pattern of life that undermines trust or brings reproach. An elder—s life must not contradict the message he is responsible to guard.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul then points to the elder—s <span data-custom-style="Strong">family life</span>. He is to be the husband of one wife, meaning he is faithful and devoted in marriage. His children are to be believers, or at least not living in open rebellion or disorder. Paul—s concern is simple: if a man cannot lead well in his own household, he cannot be trusted to care for God—s people. The home shows whether leadership is real or only claimed.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul explains why this matters by describing the elder as <span data-custom-style="Strong">God—s steward</span>. A steward is someone entrusted with another person—s property. The church belongs to God, not to the elder. Leadership is a responsibility, not a possession.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Because of that, Paul names attitudes that must not mark an elder. He must not be self-willed, quick-tempered, given to drunkenness, violent, or driven by dishonest gain. These traits all point to lack of self-control and misuse of authority. A man who cannot govern himself cannot be trusted to care for others.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul then turns to what an elder <span data-custom-style="Strong">must be</span>. He must be hospitable, loving what is good, sober-minded, just, holy, and self-controlled. These qualities describe a life that is steady, disciplined, and shaped by reverence for God. An elder—s life should make the gospel visible.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Finally, Paul addresses the elder—s relationship to teaching. He must <span data-custom-style="Strong">hold firmly to the trustworthy word as it has been taught</span>. This means he knows the apostolic message, remains loyal to it, and does not adjust it to suit culture or preference.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>That faithfulness has two purposes. First, the elder must be able to <span data-custom-style="Strong">encourage others with sound teaching</span>. Second, he must be able to <span data-custom-style="Strong">correct those who oppose it</span>. Leadership is not only care and guidance; it also includes protection. Truth must be defended so the church is not led astray.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>These verses make clear that church leadership is about trust, faithfulness, and guarding what God has given. Elders are not chosen for prominence, but for proven lives and steady commitment to the truth.</p>

<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><strong>The Danger of False Teachers and the Need for Correction (Titus 1:10—16)</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Titus 1:10-16</span></p>
</div>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p>“For there are many insubordinate (G506) , both idle talkers (G3151 and deceivers (G5423) , especially those of the circumcision (G4061) , whose mouths must be stopped , who subvert (G396) whole households , teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of dishonest gain . One of them, a prophet of their own, said, ΓÇÿCretans are always liars , evil (G2556) beasts , lazy (G692) gluttons (G1043) .— This testimony is true . Therefore rebuke (G1651) them sharply (G664) , that they may be sound (G1517) in the faith (G4102) , not giving heed (G4337) to Jewish fables and commandments (G1785) of men who turn from the truth . To the pure (G2513) all things are pure (G2513) , but to those who are defiled (G3392) and unbelieving nothing is pure (G2513) ; but even their mind (G3563) and conscience (G4893) are defiled (G3392) . They profess (G3670) to know God, but in works they deny (G720) Him, being abominable (G947) , disobedient (G545) , and disqualified (G96) for every good (G18) work (G2041) .” (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul explains why strong leadership is necessary in the church. The problem is already present. Many people refuse to submit to truth. They speak often, but their words are empty and misleading. Their talk sounds religious, but it does not lead people to obey Christ.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul highlights that this problem is especially serious among some from the circumcision. This is not about ethnicity. It is about teaching. These teachers were adding Jewish laws, traditions, and identity markers to the gospel, changing what it meant to belong to God. Faith in Christ was no longer enough. Obedience to extra rules became the measure of spirituality.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>The harm caused by this teaching is serious. Paul says they are overturning whole households. Families are being confused and pulled off course. They are teaching things they should never teach, and Paul clearly names the reason. They are doing it for dishonest gain. Their message is shaped by personal benefit, not by truth.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul then reminds Titus of the culture in Crete. A well-known saying described the people as dishonest, uncontrolled, and lazy. Paul agrees with this assessment. This matters because false teaching spreads more easily where truth, discipline, and self-control are already weak.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Because of this danger, Paul tells Titus to correct them firmly. The goal is not to punish, but to restore. Strong correction is meant to bring people back to healthy faith, not to drive them away.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul then explains what must be rejected. These teachers are focused on Jewish myths and human commands that turn people away from the truth. These myths were religious stories and traditions built around the law. They taught that spiritual standing came from rules, rituals, and lineage instead of trust in Christ. For example, believers might be told they were not truly accepted by God unless they followed food laws, purity rules, or Jewish customs, even though Christ had already made them clean. These human commands replaced heart change with outward control.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul then explains why this approach fails. “To the pure all things are pure” does not mean that anything goes. It means that a person who has been made clean inside by faith is not defiled by created things. Food, objects, and daily practices do not corrupt a heart that God has cleansed. Purity does not come from rules. It comes from an inner change.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>But the opposite is also true. To those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure. When unbelief corrupts the inner person, no rule, ritual, or practice can make them clean. Even good things are twisted, because their minds and consciences are already damaged. The problem is not what they touch, but who they trust.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul ends with a strong warning. These people say they know God, but their lives deny Him. Their actions contradict their words. Because they refuse to obey, they are not fit for good works. Knowledge without submission has left them spiritually useless.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>This passage shows that true faith always shapes how a person lives. When teaching shifts from Christ to rules, people are harmed. When leadership avoids correction, deception spreads. God cares not only about what is taught, but about what kind of lives that teaching produces.</p>
