<blockquote>
<p>God values faithful servants who live what they teach.<br />
• Church government and order is not optional or secondary issues.<br />
• Leaders must be tested in both character and belief.<br />
• Truth must be guarded for the good of God’s people.<br />
• Ignoring false teaching always leads to harm.</p>
