<p>Titus 1 explains that the health of the church depends on truth that leads to godly living, tells us how God intends His church to be ordered, and shows why leadership matters.

<p><strong>Chapter Summary</strong></p>
<p>Titus 1 begins by establishing PaulΓÇÖs authority as a servant of God and a commissioned apostle of Jesus Christ. He explains that truth is meant to lead to godly living and that this truth is grounded in the sure hope of eternal life promised by a God who cannot lie. Paul then explains why Titus was left in Crete: the churches existed, but they were unfinished and needed order. Titus is instructed to appoint qualified elders in every city to oversee and protect the churches. These leaders are to be men of proven character who hold firmly to sound teaching. The chapter closes with a warning about false teachers whose words and lives contradict the truth and must be corrected for the sake of the churchΓÇÖs health.</p>

<p><strong>Why This Chapter Matters</strong></p>
<p>Titus 1 reminds us that healthy churches do not happen by accident. God cares about who leads His people and how those leaders live. Church leadership is not a side issue, because God entrusts spiritual care to qualified elders for the good of His people. When leadership lacks integrity or conviction, the entire church is affected. This chapter helps believers understand why truth, character, order, and courage matter in the life of the church.</p>
