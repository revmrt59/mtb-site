<p><strong>DISHONEST GAIN</strong> — (<em>aischrokerdos</em>, Strong’s G150)<br />
Refers to money or profit obtained through shameful, greedy, or morally degrading means. It describes a heart that has replaced the glory of God with the love of money, turning the ministry of the Gospel into a predatory business. </p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A compound word from <em>aischros</em> (shameful, deformed, or disgraceful) and <em>kerdos</em> (gain or profit). It literally means "shameful profit." </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Sordid gain; base lucre. It refers to profit that brings dishonor to the one who receives it because of the way it was acquired—usually through deception, the exploitation of the vulnerable, or the compromising of truth. Thayer's Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The "Dirty Hands" Merchant:</strong> In the Greek marketplace, this word described a merchant who used <strong>weighted scales</strong> or sold diluted goods. The profit was "shameful" because it was stolen under the guise of a fair trade.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Religious Charlatan:</strong> It was commonly used to describe "itinerant philosophers" or priests of pagan cults who would perform "miracles" or tell fortunes specifically to <strong>extract money from the poor</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Deformed Reward:</strong> The root <em>aischros</em> refers to something <strong>physically ugly or deformed</strong>. The word picture is of a person holding gold that is covered in filth—the money itself has become "ugly" because of the "shameful" way it was earned. <a href="https://www.preceptaustin.org/titus_110-16"><u>Precept Austin</u></a> </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Scripture repeatedly warns that "no one can serve two masters" (Matthew 6:24). <em>Aischrokerdos</em> is the ultimate sign of a false teacher because it proves their "god" is their belly (Philippians 3:19). When a person views "godliness as a means of gain" (1 Timothy 6:5), they have fundamentally rejected the nature of Christ, who became poor so that we might become rich. </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:11</strong><br />
Paul uses this word to expose the <strong>true motive</strong> of the "mind-deceivers." They weren't "upsetting households" because they were passionate about Jewish Law; they were doing it because it was <strong>profitable</strong>. They targeted wealthy or vulnerable families, using "meaningless talk" to create a spiritual dependency that resulted in financial "shameful gain." </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 3:3:</strong> "...not greedy for <strong>money</strong> (<em>aischrokerdos</em>—NKJV: 'not greedy for money')." (A requirement for bishops).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 3:8:</strong> "Likewise deacons must be... not greedy for <strong>money</strong> (<em>aischrokerdos</em>)."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Peter 5:2:</strong> "Shepherd the flock of God... not for <strong>dishonest gain</strong> (<em>aischrokerdos</em>) but eagerly."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Titus 1:7:</strong> "...not greedy for <strong>money</strong> (<em>aischrokerdos</em>)." (Contrasting the true elder with the false teacher). </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
The NKJV and KJV often use the phrase <strong>"filthy lucre."</strong> This captures the visceral "uncleanness" Paul associated with this money. It is a powerful warning that any ministry driven by a "bottom line" rather than the "Great Commission" has become a source of <em>aischrokerdos</em>. Bible Hub </p>
