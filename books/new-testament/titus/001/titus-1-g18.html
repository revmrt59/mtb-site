<p><strong>GOOD</strong> — (<em>agathos</em>, Strong—s G18)<br />
Refers to that which is intrinsically beneficial, upright, and honorable. In the closing of Titus 1, it defines the standard for "works" that are divinely approved—actions that flow from a pure heart and serve a noble, God-honoring purpose. </p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A primary word (<em>agathos</em>) describing that which is "good" in its nature and "beneficial" in its effect. It is often contrasted with <em>kakos</em> (evil/harmful). Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Excellence of character; useful, salutary, or honorable. It describes something that is not only "good" in a moral sense but also "good" in a functional sense—it accomplishes something beneficial for others. Thayer—s Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Fertile Soil:</strong> In Greek agriculture, <em>agathos</em> was used for <strong>land that produced a rich harvest</strong>. It wasn't just "dirt"; it was "good" because it was productive and life-giving.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Honorable Citizen:</strong> In civic life, it described a man of <strong>noble character</strong> who contributed to the welfare of the city. He was "good" because his life added value to those around him. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Healthy Tree:</strong> A common word picture is that of a <strong>sound tree</strong> that inevitably bears "good" fruit. The fruit is "good" because the root is healthy. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
In the New Testament, "good" is not a human achievement but a reflection of God's nature. Jesus said, "No one is good but One, that is, God" (Matthew 19:17). Therefore, "good works" are only possible when a person is rightly related to the source of all goodness. They are the "fruit of the Spirit," proving that the believer has been "created in Christ Jesus for <strong>good</strong> (<em>agathos</em>) works" (Ephesians 2:10). </p>
<p>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:16<br />
The NKJV concludes the chapter by saying the false teachers are <em>"disqualified for every good (agathos) work."</em> This is a devastating</p>
