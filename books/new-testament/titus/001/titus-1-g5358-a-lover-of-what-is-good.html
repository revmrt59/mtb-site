<p><strong>A LOVER OF WHAT IS GOOD</strong> — (<em>philagathos</em>, Strong—s G5358)<br />
Refers to a person who has a natural affinity for and actively promotes everything that is morally excellent, beneficial, and honorable. In <strong>Titus 1:8</strong>, it identifies the elder as one whose heart is "pro-good," serving as a direct contrast to the "evil beasts" of the Cretan culture. Blue Letter Bible </p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A compound word from <em>philos</em> (loving/friend) and <em>agathos</em> (intrinsically good/beneficial). It literally means "a friend of goodness." Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
A lover of good; fond of good men and good things. It describes a disposition that not only approves of what is right but finds personal joy and satisfaction in the presence of virtue and the company of upright people. Thayer—s Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Patron of Virtue:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>philagathos</em> was a <strong>title of honor</strong> for a citizen who spent their life and resources supporting noble causes and the welfare of others.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Moral Magnet:</strong> A word picture associated with it is a <strong>magnet</strong>. Just as a magnet is naturally drawn to iron, the <em>philagathos</em> man is naturally "pulled" toward anything that reflects God—s character—he seeks out good books, good conversations, and good deeds. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Light-Seeker:</strong> It evokes the image of a <strong>plant turning toward the sun</strong>. He is not interested in the "shadows" of the Cretan world but is constantly "orienting" his soul toward the light of moral excellence. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
To be <em>philagathos</em> is to share God—s own heart, for "only God is good" (Matthew 19:17). Since the elder is a "steward of God" (v. 7), he must love what his Master loves. This virtue acts as a <strong>spiritual guardrail</strong>; if a man truly loves what is good, he will instinctively hate what is evil (Amos 5:15). It ensures that his leadership is driven by the desire to build up the "good" in others. BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:8</strong><br />
The <strong>NKJV</strong> says: <em>"...hospitable, <strong>a lover of what is good</strong> (philagathos), sober-minded..."</em> Paul uses this to neutralize the "Cretan virus." The Cretans were "evil (<em>kakos</em>) beasts" (v. 12). By requiring the elder to be a "lover of what is good," Paul is demanding a <strong>complete cultural break</strong>. The elder cannot be "one of the boys" who laughs at "evil" jokes or participates in "shameful" gain; his very nature must be "good-loving." <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a> </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Note: This specific word appears only once in the NT (Titus 1:8). However, its opposite appears in the list of end-times vices:</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 3:3:</strong> "...unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, <strong>despisers of good</strong> (<em>aphilagathos</em>—the negative form)..." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Philippians 4:8:</strong> "...whatever things are <strong>noble</strong>... whatever things are <strong>pure</strong>... meditate on these things." (The practical application of being a <em>philagathos</em>). </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
This virtue is the "engine" behind the <strong>"good works"</strong> mentioned at the end of the chapter (v. 16). The false teachers were "disqualified for every good work" because they were "despisers of good." The elder is qualified because he loves the very things he is called to produce in the church. Precept Austin </p>
