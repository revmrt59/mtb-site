<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A compound word from <em>a</em> (negative) + <em>sìzì</em> (to save). It literally means "unsavableness" or "the state of one who cannot be saved." It describes a person who has spent all their resources (moral and physical) and has nothing left. Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Profligacy, wastefulness, or riotous living. It is the conduct of a person who is "out of control" and has abandoned all restraint. In the New Testament, it is the opposite of "sobriety" and "discipline." Thayer—s Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Prodigal's Spending:</strong> In Aristotle—s ethics, <em>asìtia</em> was used for a person who <strong>wasted their inheritance</strong> on temporary pleasures. The word picture is of a "leaking vessel" that cannot hold anything valuable because it is full of holes. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Sinking Ship:</strong> In secular Greek literature, it was used for a <strong>shipwrecked state</strong>. It describes a person who has lost their "rudder" (self-control) and is being tossed about by every carnal impulse until they eventually sink.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Abandoned City:</strong> It evokes the image of a <strong>city with broken walls</strong>, where there is no defense against invading vices. The person is "wide open" to every destructive influence. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
<em>Asìtia</em> is the ultimate expression of the "flesh" taking over the "spirit." It is the result of rejecting the "saving" (<em>sìzì</em>) power of God. While the elder is called to be "self-controlled," his children must not be "wild." A home marked by <em>asìtia</em> indicates that the "saving" influence of the father—s leadership has failed to take root, making him unfit to lead the church. BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:6</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"...not accused of <strong>dissipation</strong> (asìtia) or insubordination."</em> In Crete, where the culture was "gluttonous" and "beastly" (v. 12), <em>asìtia</em> was the norm. Paul is demanding that the elder—s home be a <strong>moral oasis</strong>. If a man—s children are known for "riotous living" (drinking, partying, or wastefulness), that man has no moral standing to call the church to holiness. <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a> </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ephesians 5:18:</strong> "And do not be drunk with wine, in which is <strong>dissipation</strong> (<em>asìtia</em>); but be filled with the Spirit." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Peter 4:4:</strong> "...that you do not run with them in the same flood of <strong>dissipation</strong> (<em>asìtia</em>), speaking evil of you."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Luke 15:13:</strong> "...and there [the Prodigal Son] wasted his possessions with <strong>prodigal</strong> (<em>asìtìs</em>—adverb form) living." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a direct link between <em>asìtia</em> and the "gluttony" of verse 12. <em>Asìtia</em> is the <strong>social consequence</strong> of gluttony—when you live for your "belly," your life becomes a "waste." The elder's children are the "test results" of his ability to cultivate a life that is "saved" from the cultural decay of Crete. Precept Austin </p>
