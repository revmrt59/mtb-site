<p><strong>DISQUALIFIED</strong> — (<em>adokimos</em>, Strong—s G96)<br />
Refers to that which has been tested and found to be counterfeit, failing to meet the required standard. In this context, it describes a person who, despite their outward religious claims, is rejected by God as "unfit" and "useless" for any genuine good work. </p>
<h2 id="full-study">Full Study: </h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>a-</em> (negative) + <em>dokimos</em> (approved/tested). It literally means "not standing the test." Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Not standing the test; rejected, castaway, or worthless. It signifies something that has been examined by an expert and pronounced to be a fraud or of inferior quality. Thayer—s Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Counterfeit Coin:</strong> The most common use was in the <strong>ancient marketplace</strong>. If a coin was made of base metal or was underweight, the assayer would mark it <em>adokimos</em> (rejected). It looked like money, but it had no value.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Cracked Pot:</strong> Potters used this word for a <strong>vessel with a hidden crack</strong>. It might look beautiful on the shelf, but the moment it was put to use, it would leak or shatter. It was "unfit" for its purpose. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Rejected Stone:</strong> In architecture, a stone that was too soft or didn't fit the plumb line was cast aside as <em>adokimos</em>. It couldn't be used in the foundation of the building. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Being "disqualified" is the ultimate spiritual tragedy. It does not necessarily mean losing one's salvation (depending on the context), but it always means <strong>losing one's usefulness to God</strong>. When a person—s "profession" is contradicted by their "works" (v. 16), they fail the test of authenticity. They become a "spiritual fraud" whom God cannot use to represent His Truth. </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:16</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"being abominable, disobedient, and <strong>disqualified</strong> (adokimos) for every good work."</em> This is the final "eviction notice" for the false teachers. Because their minds were "defiled" and they "denied" God by their actions, they were "tested" by the standard of the Gospel and found to be <strong>fake</strong>. They are "unfit" to be elders, "unfit" to teach, and "unfit" for the very "good works" they claimed to promote. BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Corinthians 9:27:</strong> "...lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should become <strong>disqualified</strong> (<em>adokimos</em>)."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 3:8:</strong> "...men of corrupt minds, <strong>disqualified</strong> (<em>adokimos</em>) concerning the faith."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Romans 1:28:</strong> "...God gave them over to a <strong>debased</strong> (<em>adokimos</em>) mind..." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a sharp contrast between the <strong>Elder</strong> (who must be "above reproach" and "fit") and the <strong>False Teacher</strong> (who is "disqualified"). The chapter ends on this word to show that there is no "middle ground." You are either a "sound" vessel for God—s use, or you are <em>adokimos</em>—a spiritual counterfeit. Bible Hub </p>
