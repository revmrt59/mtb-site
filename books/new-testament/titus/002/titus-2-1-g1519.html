<li><p><strong>Greek Roots / Derivation:</strong> From <em>hugiēs</em> (well, whole, healthy). It is the root of our English word "hygiene".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meaning / Lexical Definition:</strong> To be in good health; to be healthy. In the pastoral epistles, it is used metaphorically to describe teaching that is "true to the original" and free from the "sickness" of false teaching.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Physician’s Report:</strong> In secular Greek, it was a medical term used to describe a body that was functioning exactly as it was designed, with no infection or injury.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Solid Foundation:</strong> It was used for a building that was "sound"-meaning it had no hidden cracks or structural weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a pure mountain spring versus a stagnant pond; one is "sound" and brings life, while the other is "unhealthy" and brings disease.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Theological Implications:</strong> Doctrine is not just a set of correct facts; it is "spiritual medicine". If doctrine is <strong>"sound,"</strong> it inevitably produces health in the person who believes it. The nature of the message determines the health of the church.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:1:</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>"But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound (hugiainō) doctrine"</strong></em>. This suggests the health of the church depended on Titus sticking to the "wholesome" Gospel that produces actual godliness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 1:10:</strong> <em><strong>"...and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound (hugiainō) doctrine,"</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 1:13:</strong> <em><strong>"Hold fast the form of sound (hugiainō) words which you have heard from me,"</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Luke 5:31:</strong> <em><strong>"Jesus answered and said to them, 'Those who are well (hugiainō) have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.'"</strong></em></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Relevant Insights:</strong> The emphasis here is on reproducibility. <strong>"Sound"</strong> doctrine isn't just "right"-it is "functional". It works as designed to form the image of Christ in a person.</p></li>
