<li><p><strong>Greek Roots / Derivation:</strong> Derived from a primary verb meaning to be eminent or to stand out. It carries the idea of being clearly seen as "right" for the occasion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meaning / Lexical Definition:</strong> To be seemly, fit, or suitable. In the New Testament, it is used to describe behavior that is appropriate for those who belong to God.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Perfectly Tailored Garment:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>prepō</em> described a garment that was so perfectly suited to the wearer that it looked exactly right on them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Royal Entrance:</strong> It was used for the dignity and decorum expected in a king’s presence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a master builder using the "proper" tool for a specific task; the tool is chosen because it is the only one that can do the job correctly.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Theological Implications:</strong> Holiness is not just avoiding sin; it is doing what is <strong>"proper"</strong>. Our conduct acts as a frame for the Gospel; when we live in a way that is "becoming" to our call, we make the truth of God attractive and clear to those watching.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:1:</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>"But as for you, speak the things which are proper (prepō) for sound doctrine"</strong></em>. Paul is telling Titus that "sound doctrine" must result in a certain kind of living. If the way we live does not match the Word we teach, it is "unbecoming" and brings confusion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Matthew 3:15:</strong> <em><strong>"But Jesus answered and said to him, 'Permit it to be so now, for thus it is fitting (prepō) for us to fulfill all righteousness.'"</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ephesians 5:3:</strong> <em><strong>"But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting (prepō) for saints;"</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hebrews 2:10:</strong> <em><strong>"For it was fitting (prepō) for Him, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory..."</strong></em></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Relevant Insights:</strong> In the ancient world, doing what was <em>prepō</em> meant living according to one's true identity. For the believer, it means our outward life finally lines up with who we have become in Christ.</p></li>
