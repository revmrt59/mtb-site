<p><strong>ADORN</strong> - (<em>kosmeō</em>, Strong’s G2885) Refers to the act of arranging, putting in order, or beautifying. It describes a life that is so "proper" and "sound" that it acts as a "spiritual ornament," making the doctrine of God attractive and clearly visible to the world.</p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> Derived from <em>kosmos</em>, which means "order," "system," or "the world" (in the sense of a harmonious arrangement).</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> To put in order, to arrange, or to garnish. It means to make something beautiful by the way it is presented. It is the root of our English word "cosmetic."</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> * <strong>The Jewel's Setting:</strong> In secular Greek, it pictured the way a jeweler sets a precious stone in a gold mounting to highlight its brilliance. The stone (the Gospel) has its own value, but the setting (<em>kosmeō</em>) makes that value "stand out."</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Garnished Room:</strong> It was used to describe a house that had been cleaned and decorated for a guest, making the environment "welcoming" and "orderly."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a frame around a masterpiece; the frame doesn't add to the painting's art, but it "arranges" the viewer's focus so the beauty of the painting is fully appreciated. <strong>"Adorning"</strong> is the "action" of making the truth "properly" visible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Doctrine is not meant to be a cold theory; it is meant to be "clothed" in a beautiful life. Since God is "infinitely good," His truth should produce a "sacred beauty" in those who follow it. To "adorn" the doctrine is the "meaning integrity" of the faith-it proves that the "internal hygiene" of the soul results in an "external order" that is attractive to outsiders.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:10</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“...that they may adorn (kosmeō) the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.”</strong></em> Paul applies this specifically to bondservants. The "lowliest" person in the social order has the power to make the "highest" truth look beautiful. By their "sound" behavior, they "garnish" the Gospel, ensuring it isn't dismissed as a mere "unhealthy" philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> * <strong>Matthew 12:44:</strong> <em><strong>“...and when he comes, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order (kosmeō).”</strong></em> * <strong>1 Timothy 2:9:</strong> <em><strong>“in like manner also, that the women adorn (kosmeō) themselves in modest apparel...”</strong></em> * <strong>Revelation 21:2:</strong> <em><strong>“...prepared as a bride adorned (kosmeō) for her husband.”</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "aesthetic" of holiness. It is the refusal to let the "leprous king of self" make the Gospel look ugly or chaotic. To <em>kosmeō</em> is to ensure that our conduct is a "spiritual container" that fits the majesty of the Message. It is the "reproducible" evidence that the "Highway of Holiness" is a path of "sacred fitness."</p>
