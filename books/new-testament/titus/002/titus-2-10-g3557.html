<p><strong>NOT PILFERING</strong> - (<em>nosphizomai</em>, Strong’s G3557) Refers to the act of setting apart for oneself, embezzling, or "skimming" off the top. It describes a "diseased" lack of integrity where one secretly keeps back what belongs to another, whereas the "sound" believer is characterized by absolute honesty.</p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> Derived from <em>nosphi</em>, meaning "apart" or "at a distance." In the middle voice, it means "to set apart for one's own use" something that belongs to someone else.</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> To purloin, embezzle, or withdraw for oneself. It specifically refers to "petty theft" or the "slow leak" of resources-taking small amounts secretly, thinking it won't be noticed or doesn't matter.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Skimming Merchant:</strong> In secular Greek, it was used for a manager who kept a portion of the profits "apart" for himself before handing the rest to the owner.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Hidden Portion:</strong> It pictured someone "distancing" a piece of the whole for their own pocket, creating a "gap" in the accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a "slow leak" in a water tank; it doesn't empty the tank all at once, but it is a "persistent drain" that eventually ruins the supply. <strong>"Not pilfering"</strong> is the "internal hygiene" of a life that has no "hidden leaks."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Honesty is the "meaning integrity" of the Gospel. Since God is "infinitely good" and the source of all provision, "pilfering" reveals a heart that doesn't trust God and is still ruled by the "leprous king of self." To be "wholly His" means even the "small things" of our finances and work are handled with "sacred fitness."</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:10</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“not pilfering (nosphizomai), but showing all good fidelity...”</strong></em> Paul commands bondservants against this because they often had access to the master's goods and food. "Pilfering" was a common "unhealthy" habit in the ancient world. By refusing to take even a "small thing," the servant demonstrates a "sound" character that stands out in a corrupt culture.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Acts 5:2-3:</strong> <em><strong>“And he kept back (nosphizomai) part of the proceeds, his wife also being aware of it... why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back (nosphizomai) part of the price of the land?”</strong></em> (This is the only other occurrence, linking the word to the fatal sin of Ananias and Sapphira).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "transparency" of the believer. It is the "action" of living as if God is the only Auditor. When a servant does not pilfer, they "adorn the doctrine" by showing that the Gospel produces "reproducible" honesty. It ensures that the "Highway of Holiness" is not littered with the "trash" of secret dishonesty.</p>
