<p><strong>LUSTS</strong> — (<em>epithymia</em>, Strong’s G1939) Refers to a deep-seated craving, a strong desire, or a "reaching out" of the soul. While it can be neutral, it most often describes "unhealthy" passions that overextend beyond God’s "sound" boundaries to seek satisfaction in the forbidden.</p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> A compound word derived from <em>epi</em> (upon or intensive) and <em>thymos</em> (passion, mind, or breath). It literally means "to have one's heart set upon" something with great intensity.</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> Desire, craving, or longing. In the New Testament, it is frequently used in a negative sense to describe "diseased" desires that war against the spirit. It is the "internal" pressure to find fulfillment outside of the "infinitely good" will of God.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> * <strong>The Reaching Hand:</strong> In secular Greek, it was used to describe a hand reaching out to grab something. It pictures the soul "extending" itself to seize an object of desire.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Boiling Pot:</strong> It pictured a internal fire or "heat" that drives a person to act. If the heat is not "governed" (soberly), the pot boils over, causing "unhealthy" chaos.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a river that has broken its banks; the water itself is natural, but because it has left its "proper" channel, it becomes a destructive force. <strong>"Lusts"</strong> are desires that have lost their "sound" boundaries.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Lust is the "action" of the "leprous king of self." It is the "spiritual revelation" of a heart that is not yet "wholly His." These cravings are "unfit" for the "Highway of Holiness" because they prioritize the "perishing" over the eternal. To deny these lusts is the "internal hygiene" required to keep the "spiritual container" of the believer pure.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:12</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“...denying ungodliness and worldly lusts (epithymia)...”</strong></em>. Paul identifies these cravings as the "unhealthy" impulses that grace trains us to reject. By saying "no" to <em>epithymia</em>, the believer maintains "meaning integrity"—proving that their deepest satisfaction is found in God, not in "secular" cravings.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> * <strong>Mark 4:19:</strong> <em><strong>“...and the desires (epithymia) for other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.”</strong></em> * <strong>Galatians 5:16:</strong> <em><strong>“I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust (epithymia) of the flesh.”</strong></em> * <strong>1 John 2:17:</strong> <em><strong>“And the world is passing away, and the lust (epithymia) of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.”</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "battlefield" of the mind. Lust is the "intoxicant" that attempts to cloud "sound" judgment. Denying these cravings is a "sacred fitness" exercise, ensuring that the believer remains "reputable" and "proper" in their conduct, reflecting the "sacred beauty" of a life governed by the Spirit rather than by "unhealthy" appetites.</p>
