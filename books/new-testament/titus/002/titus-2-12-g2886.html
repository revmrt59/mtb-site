<p><strong>WORLDLY - (<em>kosmikos</em>, Strong’s G2886)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Refers to that which belongs to the world's system or the current age. It describes a focus or quality that is "proper" to this earthly sphere but "unhealthy" and out of place for a citizen of heaven.</p>

<li><p><strong>Greek Roots / Derivation:</strong> Derived from <em>kosmos</em> (order, system, or world). In the New Testament, <em>kosmos</em> often refers to the world system that is currently alienated from God.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meaning / Lexical Definition:</strong> Of or belonging to the world; secular; earthly. It pertains to the values, perspectives, and "intoxicants" of the present age.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Foreign Garment:</strong> In secular Greek, it was used to describe something that fit the customs of the "world" at large rather than a specific local culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Temporary Structure:</strong> It pictured a building or ornament that was made for the present moment but lacked "eternal" durability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a stage set for a play; it looks real and has "proper" order within the theater, but it is <em>kosmikos</em>-it is only for the "show" and is not the "sound" reality of the world outside.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Theological Implications:</strong> To be <strong>"worldly"</strong> is to have an "internal hygiene" problem. It means the soul is being nourished by the "diseased" values of a system that is passing away. Since God is "infinitely good" and eternal, anything that is purely <em>kosmikos</em> is "unfit" for the "Highway of Holiness." It represents the "leprous" tendency of the heart to settle for the "shadow" rather than the substance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:12:</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“...denying ungodliness and worldly (kosmikos) lusts...”</strong></em>. Paul uses this to qualify the "lusts" we are to deny. It isn't just any desire; it is the specific "reaching out" after the world's "unhealthy" definition of success, pleasure, and identity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Hebrews 9:1:</strong> <em><strong>“Then indeed, even the first covenant had... the earthly (kosmikos) sanctuary.”</strong></em> (Distinguishing the physical tabernacle from the "sound," heavenly one).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Relevant Insights:</strong> This word identifies the "source" of our distractions. When we are <em>kosmikos</em>, we lack "meaning integrity" because our lives don't match our heavenly citizenship. Denying the "worldly" is the "action" of protecting our "spiritual container" from the "pollution" of the current age.</p></li>
