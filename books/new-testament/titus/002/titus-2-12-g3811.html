<p><strong>TEACHING</strong> - (<em>paideuō</em>, Strong’s G3811) Refers to the process of training, disciplining, and educating a child. It describes the "active" work of grace as a tutor that not only provides information but also corrects and shapes the believer into a "sound" and mature state.</p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> Derived from <em>pais</em>, meaning "a child." It is the root from which we get "pedagogy."</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> To train children; to instruct, to discipline, or to correct. It carries the idea of "upbringing" and "nurture." In the New Testament, it often refers to the firm but loving "pruning" and "training" that leads a person toward "sacred fitness."</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> * <strong>The Spartan Training:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>paideuō</em> was used for the rigorous training of young men to become soldiers. It involved learning what to "embrace" (courage) and what to "deny" (cowardice).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Sculptor's Chisel:</strong> It pictured the way a sculptor removes the "unhealthy" and excess stone to reveal the intended "pattern" within.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a parent teaching a child to walk; they provide both the "support" to stand and the "correction" when the child veers toward danger. <strong>"Teaching"</strong> is the "internal hygiene" that removes the "rot" of the old life.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Grace is not just a "rescue" from the past; it is a "tutor" for the present. The grace that "appeared" (<em>epiphainō</em>) now stays to <strong>"teach"</strong> us. It is the "functional" side of salvation-ensuring the believer is "wholly His" by replacing "unhealthy" desires with "sound" character. It proves that the "Highway of Holiness" is a path of constant growth and "proper" discipline.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:12</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“teaching (paideuō) us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts...”</strong></em>. Paul presents grace as a schoolmaster. It doesn't just "overlook" sin; it "trains" us out of it. This "sacred fitness" is the direct result of being in the "classroom of grace," where we learn to live in a way that is "becoming" to the Gospel.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> * <strong>Acts 7:22:</strong> <em><strong>“And Moses was learned (paideuō) in all the wisdom of the Egyptians...”</strong></em> * <strong>1 Corinthians 11:32:</strong> <em><strong>“But when we are judged, we are chastened (paideuō) by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.”</strong></em> * <strong>Hebrews 12:6:</strong> <em><strong>“For whom the Lord loves He chastens (paideuō)...”</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "reproducible" discipline of the Christian life. To be under the <em>paideuō</em> of grace is to have a "safe mind" that recognizes the "meaning integrity" of God's rules. It is the "action" of grace that ensures our "spiritual container" is constantly being cleaned and prepared for "good works."</p>
