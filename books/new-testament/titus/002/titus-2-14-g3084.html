<p><strong>REDEEM - (<em>lytroō</em>, Strong’s G3084)</strong></p>
<p>To release by the payment of a ransom price. In Titus 2:14, it refers to Christ’s act of purchasing us out of the bondage and condemnation of sin, delivering us from the authority of "every lawless deed" through the sacrifice of His own life.</p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> Derived from <em>lytron</em> (the price of a ransom), which comes from the verb <em>lyō</em>, meaning "to loose," "to untie," or "to break a bond." The word specifically describes a liberation that is achieved through a required payment.</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> To release a captive or a slave after a ransom has been paid; to set at liberty by paying the price of the release. It is a legal and sacrificial term denoting that a person has been bought back from a state of forfeiture or debt.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Slave Market:</strong> In the ancient world, this was the standard word used when a person’s freedom was purchased. Once the <em>lytron</em> (ransom) was paid, the slave was no longer under the authority of their former master.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Battlefield Ransom:</strong> It was used for the payment made to recover a prisoner of war who was being held by an enemy. The payment effectively "loosed" them from their captivity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a legal document that proves a debt has been satisfied. The person is no longer "tied" to their previous obligation because the price has been paid in full by another.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Redemption is the act that satisfies the justice of God. Because sin carries a debt and a sentence of death, we were held under its power and condemnation. Christ’s death was the ransom price that "loosed" us from that claim. This means we are no longer under the dominion of sin or the curse of the Law; we have been purchased by Christ to belong to God.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:14</strong> The NKJV says: <em>“who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem (lytroō) us from every lawless deed...”</em> Paul uses this word to show that the work of the Cross has a specific purpose: to break the claim of "lawlessness" over our lives. We are not just forgiven for the past; we are "bought back" from the very power of sin so that we can be transformed.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Peter 1:18–19:</strong> <em>“knowing that you were not redeemed (lytroō) with corruptible things, like silver or gold... but with the precious blood of Christ...”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Luke 24:21:</strong> <em>“But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem (lytroō) Israel.”</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> Redemption implies a total transfer of ownership. We have been "bought with a price" (1 Cor. 6:20), which means our old life is finished and we now belong to the One who redeemed us. It is a definitive, finished work that provides the legal and spiritual basis for us to live a holy life.</p>
