<p><strong>ENSLAVED</strong> - (<em>douloō</em>, Strong’s G1402) Refers to being brought into a state of bondage or subjection. In the context of "much wine," it describes a life where an appetite or substance has become the "master," preventing the believer from being fully yielded to the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> Derived from <em>doulos</em>, meaning a slave or bondservant. It carries the idea of being under the absolute authority and control of another.</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> To make a slave of, to reduce to bondage, or to bring into subjection. It describes a condition where one is no longer their own master but is compelled to serve the will of someone or something else.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Captive of War:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>douloō</em> was used for a soldier who was captured in battle and forced into a life of service to his conqueror.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Debt Slave:</strong> It described a person who had lost their freedom because they could not pay what they owed, resulting in their life being "owned" by another.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a person holding a leash; the one "enslaved" is the one on the end of the leash, forced to go wherever the master pulls.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> The human heart is always serving a master. To be "enslaved" to anything other than Christ is to live in a state of spiritual "sickness." This word highlights that grace does not just forgive us; it changes who owns us. We are called to be "wholly His," which means we cannot allow any "other" master-including physical appetites-to sit on the throne of our lives.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:3</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“the older women likewise, that they be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not given (douloō) to much wine...”</strong></em>. Paul uses the perfect passive participle here, suggesting a settled state of being "under the power" of wine. He warns that the older women must remain clear-headed and alert so they can fulfill their call to be "teachers of good things."</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Romans 6:18:</strong> <em><strong>“And having been set free from sin, you became slaves (douloō) of righteousness.”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Corinthians 9:19:</strong> <em><strong>“For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a servant (douloō) to all, that I might win the more;”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Peter 2:19:</strong> <em><strong>“...for by whom a person is overcome, by him also he is brought into bondage (douloō).”</strong></em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> In the "Mastering the Bible" framework, being <em>douloō</em> to wine is the opposite of being "sound." It creates a fog that obscures the "presence" of God. For the older woman, her life is to be a "revelation" of the Kingdom; if she is in bondage to a substance, her testimony is silenced and her "sacred fitness" (<em>hieroprepēs</em>) is compromised.</p>
