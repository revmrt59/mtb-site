<p><strong>REVERENT</strong> — (<em>hieroprepēs</em>, Strong’s G2412) Refers to that which is suited to a sacred person, place, or thing. It describes a life that is so "proper" for the Gospel that it carries the atmosphere of the temple into every ordinary area of life.</p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> Derived from <em>hieros</em> (sacred or holy) and <em>prepō</em> (to be fit or becoming). It literally means "suited to a sacred task".</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> Befitting a holy person; suited to a sacred character. It denotes behavior that is consistent with being a "priest" in God’s house.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Temple Priestess:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>hieroprepēs</em> was used to describe the dignity and conduct required of those who served in a temple.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Sacred Ornament:</strong> It described an object that was not merely functional but was "becoming" to a place of worship.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a person wearing "temple garments" in a common marketplace; their very appearance reminds everyone around them that they belong to another world.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Holiness is not just avoiding "bad" behavior; it is maintaining a "sacred fitness". This word reveals that the older women are to live as if they are always "on duty" in the temple of God, treating their daily lives as a continuous act of worship.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:3</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“the older women likewise, that they be reverent (hieroprepēs) in behavior…”</strong></em>. Paul uses this specific word to show that an older woman’s "behavior" (how she carries herself) should be a "matching piece" to her sacred identity in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This specific word (<em>hieroprepēs</em>) appears only here in the New Testament, emphasizing the unique, "priestly" dignity Paul expects from older women in the church.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This term differs from the <em>semnos</em> used for older men. While <em>semnos</em> emphasizes dignity that commands respect, <em>hieroprepēs</em> emphasizes a "sacred beauty" that is fit for God’s presence. It suggests that their lives should be "life-giving revelation" rather than just moral performance.</p>
