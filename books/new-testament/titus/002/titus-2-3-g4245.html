<li><p><strong>Greek Roots / Derivation:</strong> The feminine form of <em>presbytēs</em> (an old man). It carries the same root idea of seniority and seasoned experience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meaning / Lexical Definition:</strong> An aged woman or an elderly woman. In the New Testament context, it refers specifically to women within the church who are recognized for their years and the spiritual weight they carry.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Matriarch’s Influence:</strong> In ancient Greek culture, the <em>presbytis</em> was the respected female head of a household whose wisdom governed the domestic sphere.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Trusted Mentor:</strong> It described a woman whose life experience made her a natural guide for younger women in matters of character and family.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a master weaver who has spent a lifetime at the loom; she not only knows the patterns but can spot a single misplaced thread and show another how to fix it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Theological Implications:</strong> Age for a woman in the church is intended to be a platform for "holy behavior". This title implies that her years have produced a "soundness" that makes her a reliable channel of God's grace and instruction to the younger women.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:3:</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“the older women (presbytis) likewise, that they be reverent in behavior...”</strong></em>. Paul uses the word "likewise" to show that the same high standard of "soundness" expected of the older men is now applied to the older women, specifically in how they model holiness to the church.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This specific word (<em>presbytis</em>) appears only here in the New Testament, though its masculine counterpart and related terms for "widows" (<em>chēra</em>) appear frequently to describe the honored status of aged women in the faith.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Relevant Insights:</strong> While the word refers to chronological age, the focus is on the "spiritual transaction" of a life that has been tested and found faithful. She is not just an "old woman"; she is an authorized voice of wisdom in the community.</p></li>
