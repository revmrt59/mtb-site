<p><strong>ADMONISH</strong> — (<em>sōphronizō</em>, Strong’s G4994) Refers to the act of restoring someone to their senses, training them in self-control, or encouraging them to be "of a sound mind." It is a restorative process that brings clarity and "spiritual health" to the younger generation.</p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> Derived from <em>sōphrōn</em> (of sound mind, temperate), which comes from <em>sōos</em> (safe/sound) and <em>phrēn</em> (the mind). It is the verbal form that means "to make sound."</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> To recall to one's senses, to bring to one's right mind, or to train in self-control. It carries a strong sense of mentoring or "coaching" someone toward spiritual maturity and sobriety of thought.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Physician’s Treatment:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>sōphronizō</em> was used for a treatment that restored a person from a state of delirium or "insanity" back to their "safe mind."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Wise Counselor:</strong> It described the work of a mentor who helped a young person "curb" their wild impulses so they could live a disciplined, "proper" life.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a mirror being wiped clean of fog; the act of "admonishing" helps the younger person see the truth clearly so they can act with "sound judgment."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Holiness requires a "safe mind." Since the world often produces a "clouded" or "unhealthy" way of thinking, the body of Christ needs this "restorative" teaching. To <em>sōphronizō</em> is to participate in the "renewal of the mind," helping others to live as those who are "wholly His."</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:4</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“that they [the older women] admonish (sōphronizō) the young women to love their husbands...”</strong></em>. Paul uses this word to show that "loving a husband" or "loving children" isn't just an emotion; it is a "sound-minded" discipline that often needs to be taught and modeled by those who are more seasoned in the faith.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This specific verb (<em>sōphronizō</em>) appears <strong>only here</strong> in the New Testament. However, its root <em>sōphrōn</em> is used throughout the Pastoral Epistles to describe the "sober-mindedness" required of leaders and believers (e.g., Titus 1:8, 2:2, 2:5).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This term emphasizes the <strong>gentleness and wisdom</strong> of the older women. They are not merely "correcting" with a heavy hand; they are "restoring" the younger women to a place of "spiritual health." It is the "functional" application of "sound doctrine"—taking the truth and making it practical for the home.</p>
