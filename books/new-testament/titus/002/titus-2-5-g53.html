<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> From the same root as <em>hagios</em> (holy/saint). It carries the idea of being "awful" in the original sense-something so pure it inspires awe or reverence.</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> Exciting reverence, venerable, or pure. In the New Testament, it specifically refers to being pure from carnality and modest in conduct and thought. It is the absence of any "mixture" with the world’s impurity.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Sacred Vessel:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>hagnos</em> described a vessel that had been ceremonially cleansed for use in a temple; it was no longer "common" but was dedicated to a specific, holy purpose.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Unblemished Offering:</strong> It pictured a sacrifice that was "clean" and without spot-worthy of being presented to a deity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a perfectly clear diamond with no internal "clouds" or inclusions; the <strong>"chaste"</strong> life is transparent and focused, with no hidden "admixtures" of compromise.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Chastity is the outward manifestation of being "wholly His." It is not merely the absence of sin, but the presence of a "singular focus" on Christ. It reveals that the believer’s heart is a "temple" that must remain unpolluted so that the presence of God can be hosted with excellence.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:5</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“to be discreet, chaste (hagnos), homemakers...”</strong></em>. Paul connects being "discreet" (sound-minded) with being "chaste." If the mind is "safe" and "sound," the behavior will be pure. For the young woman, being <em>hagnos</em> ensures that her loyalty and her character remain "uncorrupted" by the culture around her.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>2 Corinthians 11:2:</strong> <em><strong>“For I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste (hagnos) virgin to Christ.”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Philippians 4:8:</strong> <em><strong>“Finally, brethren, whatever things are true... whatever things are pure (hagnos)... meditate on these things.”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 John 3:3:</strong> <em><strong>“And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure (hagnos).”</strong></em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> In the "Mastering the Bible" framework, this word represents the "reproducible" beauty of holiness. To be <em>hagnos</em> is to ascribing "heaven’s value" to one’s own body and spirit. It is the refusal to let the "leprous king" of worldly desire defile what God has made "sacred."</p>
