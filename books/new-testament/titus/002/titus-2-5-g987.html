<p><strong>BLASPHEMED</strong> - (<em>blasphēmeō</em>, Strong’s G987) Refers to speaking reproachfully, railing against, or reviling. In this context, it describes the tragic result of a believer’s life contradicting their profession, which causes outsiders to speak evil of God’s Word and character.</p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> Derived from <em>blaptō</em> (to hinder or injure) and <em>phēmē</em> (speech or report). It literally means "to speak so as to injure the reputation" of another.</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> To speak evil of, to defame, or to revile. In a biblical context, it refers to speech that slanders the nature, power, or Word of God. It is the act of bringing "reproach" upon that which is sacred.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Slanderous Witness:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>blasphēmeō</em> was used in legal settings for a witness who intentionally lied to "injure" the character of the accused.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Ripping Garment:</strong> It was often pictured as the "tearing" of a person’s reputation-taking something that should be whole and respected and "ripping" it apart with words.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a counterfeit coin; because it is "unhealthy" and false, it brings the entire currency into question. When a believer’s life is "unsound," the "Word of God" is treated like a counterfeit by those watching.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> The reputation of God in the earth is linked to the conduct of His people. Since the Word of God is "sound" and "infinitely good," it should produce a "proper" life. When it does not, the Word itself is <strong>"blasphemed"</strong>-not because the Word changed, but because the "vessel" carrying it appeared "diseased." This is the ultimate "unhealthy" outcome that "sound doctrine" seeks to prevent.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:5</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“...obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed (blasphēmeō).”</strong></em>. Paul identifies this as the "purpose" for the young women’s training. Their "sound" living at home acts as a shield for the Gospel; it prevents the "bad eye" of the world from finding a reason to slander the truth.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Romans 2:24:</strong> <em><strong>“For 'the name of God is blasphemed (blasphēmeō) among the Gentiles because of you,' as it is written.”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 6:1:</strong> <em><strong>“...that the name of God and His doctrine may not be blasphemed (blasphēmeō).”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Titus 3:2:</strong> <em><strong>“to speak evil (blasphēmeō) of no one, to be peaceable, gentle...”</strong></em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> In the "Mastering the Bible" framework, avoiding blasphemy is about "meaning integrity." If the life doesn't match the message, the "reproducible" power of the Gospel is lost. To live so that the Word is NOT blasphemed is the highest form of "sacred fitness"-ensuring that the "Highway of Holiness" is attractive and undeniable to those who are currently "outside."</p>
