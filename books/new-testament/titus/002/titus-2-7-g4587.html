<p><strong>REVERENCE</strong> - (<em>semnotēs</em>, Strong’s G4587) Refers to a serious, dignified, and honorable manner that commands respect. It describes a life that carries a "spiritual weightiness" because it is lived with a constant awareness of God’s presence, making the Gospel appear as majestic as it truly is.</p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> The noun form of <em>semnos</em> (which we studied for the older men). It is derived from <em>sebomai</em>, meaning "to worship" or "to revere."</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> Dignity, gravity, or majesty. It refers to a character that is "venerable"-not because of age, but because of its alignment with the sacred. In teaching, it is the quality that prevents the Word of God from being treated as "common" or trivial.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Weight of the Magistrate:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>semnotēs</em> was used to describe the "gravitas" of a judge or high official whose presence brought order and seriousness to a room.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Temple Atmosphere:</strong> It pictured the "hallowed" air of a sanctuary-a place where voices are lowered and behavior is adjusted because of the importance of the setting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a heavy, gold vessel; it has "substance." A life of <em>semnotēs</em> has "spiritual substance" that doesn't blow away when the "winds" of culture or trial strike.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Reverence is the outward evidence of "sacred fitness." Since God is "infinitely good" and "majestic," those who represent Him must carry a "matching" dignity. It is the refusal to be flippant or "lightweight" with the things of God. This "gravity" ensures that the "Highway of Holiness" is respected by those who observe it.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:7</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“...in doctrine showing integrity, reverence (semnotēs), incorruptibility,”</strong></em>. Paul links reverence directly to the "pattern" of doctrine. Titus’s manner was to be as "sound" as his message. If the teacher is "lightweight" or joking about sacred things, the "meaning integrity" of the doctrine is lost.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 2:2:</strong> <em><strong>“...that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence (semnotēs).”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 3:4:</strong> <em><strong>“one who rules his own house well, having his children in submission with all reverence (semnotēs);”</strong></em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "seriousness" of the spiritual life. It is not about being "joyless," but about being "weighty." It is the manifestation of a heart that values what God values. In the home or the church, <em>semnotēs</em> acts as a "spiritual container" that holds the truth with the honor it deserves.</p>
