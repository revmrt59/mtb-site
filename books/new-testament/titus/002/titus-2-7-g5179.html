<li><p><strong>Greek Roots / Derivation:</strong> From <em>typtō</em>, meaning "to strike." It originally referred to the mark or "print" left by a blow or a stamp.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meaning / Lexical Definition:</strong> An image, form, or model. In the New Testament, it refers to a person or thing that serves as a pattern for others to follow, specifically in the context of moral and spiritual conduct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Sculptor’s Cast:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>typos</em> was the mold used to cast a statue; any metal poured into it would take on the exact shape of the pattern.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Seal and Wax:</strong> It pictured the impression left by a signet ring in hot wax; the "pattern" in the wax is an identical match to the ring that struck it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a master architect’s scale model; the "pattern" is a reliable guide that shows exactly how the full-scale building should look.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Theological Implications:</strong> A believer’s life is meant to be a "living impression" of the Gospel. To be a <strong>"pattern"</strong> means the "sound doctrine" has struck the heart so deeply that the life now carries the unmistakable shape of Christ. It is the "meaning integrity" of the faith—where the truth is not just heard, but seen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:7:</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>"in all things showing yourself to be a pattern (typos) of good works..."</strong></em> Paul shifts his focus to Titus himself, emphasizing that the teacher must be the "master mold" for the students. If the leader’s life is not a "sound" pattern, the "good works" of the followers will be distorted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>John 20:25:</strong> <em><strong>"Unless I see in His hands the print (typos) of the nails..."</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 4:12:</strong> <em><strong>"...but be an example (typos) to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity."</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Peter 5:3:</strong> <em><strong>"...nor as being lords over those entrusted to you, but being examples (typos) to the flock."</strong></em></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Relevant Insights:</strong> This word represents the "reproducible" nature of holiness. To be a <em>typos</em> is to provide an "East Gate" for others—a visible entrance into a walk with God. It ensures that the "Highway of Holiness" is not just a theory, but a practical path that can be followed.</p></li>
