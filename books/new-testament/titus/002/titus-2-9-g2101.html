<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> A compound word formed from <em>eu</em> (well/good) and <em>arestos</em> (pleasing/acceptable), which comes from <em>areskō</em> (to satisfy).</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> Fully agreeable, well-pleasing, or acceptable. It denotes a quality of service that is so "proper" and "excellent" that it leaves the recipient completely satisfied. It is the "functional" result of doing a task with a "good" heart.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Perfect Offering:</strong> In ancient religious contexts, <em>euarestos</em> was used for a sacrifice that was "unblemished" and "fit" for the altar-it was exactly what the deity required.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Satisfied Master:</strong> It described a servant who didn't just "do the job," but did it with such "internal hygiene" and skill that the master was "well-pleased" with the result.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a musician playing a piece of music with perfect "meaning integrity"-not a single note is out of place, and the performance brings a "sweet" delight to the listener.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> The aim of the believer is to be "well-pleasing" to God. Since God is "infinitely good," our response should be a "sacred fitness" that seeks to delight Him in everything. This is not about earning favor, but about reflecting His character. A "well-pleasing" life is one that is "wholly His," where every "action" is a "spiritual revelation" of His grace.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:9</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“...to be obedient to their own masters, to be well-pleasing (euarestos) in all things...”</strong></em>. Paul instructs bondservants to aim for this high standard. By being "well-pleasing," the servant proves that the "sound doctrine" of Christ makes them the best, most "reputable" workers. This "proper" conduct makes the Gospel attractive to their masters.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Romans 12:1:</strong> <em><strong>“...present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable (euarestos) to God...”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Corinthians 5:9:</strong> <em><strong>“Therefore we make it our aim, whether present or absent, to be well-pleasing (euarestos) to Him.”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hebrews 13:21:</strong> <em><strong>“...working in you what is well-pleasing (euarestos) in His sight, through Jesus Christ...”</strong></em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "quality control" of the Christian life. It is the refusal to be "unhealthy" or "lukewarm" in our responsibilities. To be <em>euarestos</em> is to "adorn the doctrine" by ensuring our "spiritual container" is filled with "excellent" fruit. It ensures that the "Highway of Holiness" is a path of "sacred beauty" that others want to follow.</p>
