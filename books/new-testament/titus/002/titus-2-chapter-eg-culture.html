<p><em>We exist to elevate and empower sons and daughters to be the place where heaven touches earth. We are committed to teaching you how to hear God—s voice, connect with Him daily, and walk with Him in obedience.</em></p>
<h2 id="secret-place-five-more-minutes">SECRET PLACE | Five More Minutes</h2>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Titus 2 is transformation empowered by grace. And grace is encountered in relationship.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Older men do not become steady by accident.<br />
Young men do not become disciplined by a motivational pep-talk.<br />
Workers do not remain faithful under injustice by willpower alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>If we neglect the secret place, we will eventually replace grace with pressure and religious duty. Holiness will feel heavy instead of empowered.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Healthy doctrine flows from healthy devotion.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>HEALTH | Trickle Down</strong></p>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Paul commands Titus to teach “sound” doctrine so that healthy lives emerge. Health spreads from the top down and from the inside out.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Leadership health trickles down to congregational health. This is why Paul spoke to Titus— own life and not just his teaching.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p>Titus 2:7 in all things showing yourself to be a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing integrity, reverence, incorruptibility, (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Health trickles down. It comes from the inside out. Inner life shapes outer conduct.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>We are not healthy merely when behavior appears disciplined. We are healthy when our thoughts, feelings, desires, and responses reflect God—s heart.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>PEOPLE OF THE WORD | The School of Grace</strong></p>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p>Titus 2:11-12 For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men, 12 teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age, (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Grace trains us to renounce ungodliness. It is an enabling power.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>As People of the Word, we do not merely read Scripture. We walk it out as a community. Doctrine becomes culture when it is practiced collectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The clear evidence we are “people of the Word” is a grace-filled, grace-taught, transformed life.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>HONOR | Through His Eyes</strong></p>
<p>Titus 2 presses deeply into relational maturity - how older treat younger, how younger respond to older, how believers conduct themselves under authority. How workers and believers respond in submission like Jesus when pressed in unfairness and mistreatment.</p>
<p>Honor is not agreement. It is recognizing God-given value and structure. Even when circumstances are unfair, we honor people, authority, and structure.</p>
<p>Older believers honor younger ones through investment.<br />
Younger believers honor older ones through humility.<br />
Workers honor leaders.<br />
Leaders honor those they lead.</p>
<p>Honor protects culture. Honor promotes health. Honor adorns the Gospel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FELLOWSHIP | Assembly Required</strong></p>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Titus 2 assumes engaged and active intergenerational and interpersonal relationships.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Older women train and disciple younger women. Young men are exhorted. Leaders are to model integrity publicly. This is fellowship — joint participation in the discipling and maturing of the body of Christ.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This cannot happen in isolation and apart from engaged relationship. Spiritual health spreads through intentional investment across generations. When older believers withdraw, younger believers lose their examples and teachers. When younger believers fail to look to others for guidance and mentoring, growth can stagnate.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>A healthy church requires true fellowship, believers in engaged relationship, training and being trained as followers of Jesus.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>EMPOWERMENT | Model &amp; Invite</strong></p>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p>Titus 2:7 in all things showing yourself to be a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing integrity, reverence, incorruptibility, (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Titus is commanded to be a “pattern of good works.” He is to “show” integrity. To replicate and strengthen the church, Titus needed to model what a pattern of good works and integrity looked like.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>We model first. Then we invite others to follow.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>EXCELLENCE | Your Best, His Glory</strong></p>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p>Titus 2:9-10 Exhort bondservants to be obedient to their own masters, to be well pleasing in all things, not answering back, 10 not pilfering, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things. (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Bondservants are called to faithfulness and integrity, even in the midst of unpleasant or unfair environment so that they “adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.”</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Your work either beautifies the gospel or distorts it. We work and live unto the Lord for His glory. It is not about us our situation. It is all about Him</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Excellence is not perfectionism. It is wholehearted faithfulness and serving to the best of your ability, regardless of the circumstance, earthly reward, or even if someone notices. It is finishing what you start. It is speaking carefully. It is keeping commitments.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>In the age we live, quiet excellence preaches the Gospel.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>GENEROSITY | It—s Not Ours Anyway</strong></p>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p>Titus 2:14 who gave Himself for usΓÇª (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Christ “gave Himself for us.” Generosity is rooted in redemption. We give because He gave.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>A people who have received of His generosity, become a generous and open-handed people , not just financially, but with time, honor, patience, and service.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The good works that Paul speaks of in Titus 2, not only flow from grace, but from gratitude of God—s generous gift of the Son.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>WE AWAIT HIS RETURN</strong></p>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p><em>Jesus went to prepare a place for us so that we could be with Him forever. He promised to return for His bride and it is our HONOR to prepare and wait expectantly for Him. Our greatest desire is to be found ready when our Beloved returns.<br />
</em></p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The commands and instruction in Titus 2 are anchored not only in the grace of Jesus— cross, but also the glory of His return and in the “blessed hope” of Christ—s appearing.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>We deny ungodliness because we are looking for Him.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>We endure injustice because we are looking for Him.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>We remain faithful because we are looking for Him.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>A church that expects His return takes holiness seriously without becoming legalistic.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>We live as a "special people," zealously preparing ourselves so that we are found ready when our Beloved returns.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>It is our honor to live soberly and godly in this present age as we wait expectantly for Him to return for His bride.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>COMMUNICATION | Real Talk for Real Relationships</strong></p>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p>Titus 2:15 Speak these things, exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you. (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Paul told Titus to speak the things people need to hear, not necessarily what they wanted to hear. We are not do despise having someone have real-talk with us.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Following Paul—s mandate to "speak," we choose to have 100% of our conversations with honesty and open hearts.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>We "real talk" about the things people need to hear, even when it is awkward or causes opposition, because it leads to stronger relationships tomorrow.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
