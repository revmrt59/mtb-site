<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><strong>Titus 2:1</strong> But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine: (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<p>In Titus 2:1—10 (NKJV), Paul describes the fruit of healthy doctrine. Sound teaching is not merely something we agree with; it is something that transforms our lives and how we live. When doctrine is healthy, it produces stable men, reverent women, disciplined young believers, trustworthy workers, and credible leaders. When doctrine is corrupt, life deteriorates. This chapter shows that the gospel must become visible in every age group and every role within the church. Healthy teaching bears healthy lives.</p>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul shifts from describing false teachers at the end of chapter 1 to giving Titus direct instruction. The contrast is deliberate. Others are spreading empty and destructive teaching. Titus must speak something different. His teaching must lead to health.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“But as for you”</span> sets Titus apart. He is not to imitate the teaching, content, motives, or methods of those who distort the truth. He is to stand in contrast and in truth.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Speak”</span> is active and continual. Titus is not merely to believe sound doctrine privately or assume it will spread on its own. He must articulate it. Shepherding requires verbal clarity. Truth must be declared, not implied.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“The things which are proper”</span> means what fits, what accords with, what is consistent with. Paul is not calling for random religious speech. He is calling for teaching that matches and flows out of true doctrine.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Sound doctrine”</span> carries the idea of health. It is teaching that is whole, stable, life-giving. In chapter 1, Paul exposed teaching that was diseased and corrupting households. Here, he calls for doctrine that produces spiritual health.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>This verse does two things.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>First, it anchors all the behavioral instructions that follow. Everything about older men, older women, younger believers, and servants in the workplace flows from doctrine. Conduct is not disconnected from belief.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Second, it establishes the responsibility of leadership. A healthy church begins with healthy teaching. If doctrine is distorted, life will follow. If doctrine is sound, life will bear fruit.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Titus 2:1 sets the tone for the chapter: truth must be spoken clearly, and it must be the kind of truth that produces transformed lives. This instruction prepares the reader for what follows. He tells Titus to teach to the to the natural pressure points within each group in the church. Sound teaching does not avoid areas of weakness, it uses the Word of God to strengthen them and bring people to health and maturity.</p>
</div>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Titus 2:2 (NKJV)</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis"><strong>“that the older men be sober, reverent, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in patience.”</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul begins with older men. That matters. If the older men are steady, the church will be steady. If they are unstable, the weakness spreads.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Sober”</span> means clear-minded and self-controlled. An older man is not to be ruled by impulse or appetite. His judgment should be steady.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Reverent”</span> means dignified. There should be weight to his life. His life should carry maturity and the Presence. Not harshness. Not stiffness. But seriousness about what matters to the Lord.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Temperate”</span> again points to self-control. Age alone does not produce maturity. Discipline does. Paul is not assuming older men are automatically stable. He is calling them to be.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Then he returns to the language of health: <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“sound in faith, in love, in patience.”</span></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Sound in faith means steady trust in God. Not drifting. No coasting into eternity. Not hardened. Still bearing fruit in their old age.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Sound in love means active care for others. Long years should deepen compassion, not shrink it.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Sound in patience means endurance. The ability to remain steady under pressure without becoming bitter. The ability to be patient with, and nurture immature believers.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>There is likely pastoral wisdom in what Paul emphasizes. Older men can face certain pressure points that come with both physical age and years in the kingdom: cynicism instead of faith, irritability instead of patience, indulgence instead of self-control, withdrawal instead of love, and a sense of entitlement. Paul seeks to strengthen those very areas.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Spiritual maturity is not automatic with age. It must remain healthy. When older men are mature in faith, love, and endurance, the whole church benefits.</p>
</div>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><strong>Titus 2:3-5 (NKJV)</strong><br />
“the older women likewise, that they be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things. that they admonish the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 5 to be discreet, chaste, homemakers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed. (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<p><span data-custom-style="citation-2103">In <strong>Titus 2:3—5 (NKJV)</strong>, Paul continues what healthy teaching looks like by outlining the character and responsibilities of older women</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>“Likewise” connects this to what Paul just said about older men. Sound doctrine is not limited to one group. Spiritual health is not for a select few. It is for all believers. Older women are just as responsible to live it out.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Reverent in behavior”</span> means their lives should reflect devotion to God. Not just in private belief, but in visible conduct. Their character should match their confession.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Not slanderers”</span> addresses the danger of destructive speech. The word is strong. It refers to accusing or tearing others down. With years comes experience and influence. Words can either strengthen the church or quietly damage it. Paul speaks directly to that pressure point.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Not given to much wine”</span> again calls for self-control. Maturity does not excuse indulgence or give us an excuse to live however we want. Older women are to be disciplined, not governed by appetite or escape.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>Then Paul turns to responsibility: Older women are to be <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“teachers of good things.”</span> They are not only to avoid harm but to actively pass on what is good. Their role is to encourage and instruct younger women in practical godliness.</p>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul is not listing random qualities. He speaks directly to areas where older women could drift. Speech can become critical instead of encouraging. Discipline can give way to indulgence. Experience can turn into withdrawal instead of intentional investment in others. Sound doctrine addresses those weaknesses before they cause damage.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<blockquote>
<p>Paul strengthens the areas where older women could drift. Speech must not become gossip. Hearts must not become bitter. Self-control must remain steady. Influence must be used to build up the next generation.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Verse 4 continues the thought from verse 3. Older women are to be “teachers of good things,” and this is what that looks like. Their role is not vague encouragement. It is intentional investment in younger women.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Admonish”</span> carries the idea of training or urging toward wise, self-controlled living. This is not harsh correction. It is steady guidance. It is healthy “mothering”. Paul assumes that younger women need instruction. Marriage and motherhood do not automatically come with maturity. They require discipleship.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“To love their husbands”</span> uses a word that speaks of devoted, affectionate love. It is relational and personal. It emphasizes warmth, loyalty, and daily commitment. This is different from Ephesians 5, where husbands are commanded to love their wives with agape love, a self-sacrificing love patterned after Christ. There the emphasis is sacrificial leadership. Here the emphasis is affectionate devotion. Both matter. Marriage requires both strength and tenderness.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“To love their children”</span> uses the same family-centered word for love. It highlights intentional affection and responsibility. This is not automatic sentiment. It is active, daily care.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Paul addresses real pressure points. Affection in marriage can cool. Disappointment can chill affection, harden the heart. Fatigue in parenting can drain joy. Cultural voices can downplay the value of faithfulness in the home. Paul reinforces love at its most foundational level. Love in the home and family must be cultivated.</p>
<p>Healthy doctrine reaches into the closest relationships. It is seen first in the home. Paul—s point, healthy marriages, make healthy families, which make healthy churches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Verse 5 continues the description of what that cultivated love looks like in practice.</p>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“To be discreet”</span> speaks of self-control and sober-mindedness. It is inner stability. It is not driven by impulse or emotion. Sound doctrine produces clear thinking and steady reactions.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Chaste”</span> refers to moral purity. It includes faithfulness in marriage and integrity in conduct. The Christian life is not merely outward conformity. It is purity that begins in the heart.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Homemakers”</span> points to faithful stewardship of the household. The home is not treated as secondary or insignificant. It is a primary arena of kingdom faithfulness. Managing it well requires wisdom, diligence, and strength.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Good”</span> describes active goodness, kindness that shows itself in action. It is moral beauty lived out in daily decisions.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Obedient to their own husbands”</span> speaks of ordered alignment within marriage. It is not about inferiority. It is about God-designed harmony. Christian marriage is not competition; it is cooperation under God—s authority.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>Then Paul gives the reason: so that the word of God is not spoken against.</p>
<p>That is the weight of the passage. The credibility of God—s Word is tied to the visible lives of God—s people. When Christian homes are marked by love, purity, stability, and order, the gospel is honored. When they are marked by chaos, harshness, or rebellion, the message is discredited in the eyes of observers.</p>
<p>Paul is not merely giving domestic advice. He is protecting the reputation of the gospel. Sound doctrine must be lived out and become visible in the home.</p>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><strong>Titus 2:6</strong> Likewise, exhort the young men to be sober-minded. (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul now turns from older men, older women, and younger women to younger men. The pattern remains the same. Heathy doctrine will impact the lives of younger men.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>The word <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“likewise”</span> matters. Younger men are not to be left to figure things out on their own. Titus is to speak directly to them.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Exhort”</span> carries weight. This is not casual suggestion. It is serious urging. Young men require clear, direct instruction. Paul does not assume maturity will arrive with age. Paul does not want us to let young men drift. He knows maturity and spiritual health in young men must be cultivated.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“To be sober-minded”</span> is the core command. One translation says “teach the young men to be sensible”. If there is something young men lack, it is sensibility from the thing they purchase, to the stupid things they do. This word speaks of self-control, sound judgment, disciplined thinking. Paul knows young men need to be taught inner restraint.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Young men often feel strong impulses. Energy, drive, desire for independence, appetite for risk. These can be strengths. But without self-control they become destructive. Paul addresses the pressure point directly. Immaturity, impulsiveness, pride, and uncontrolled desire can undo a man before he ever becomes stable.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Sound doctrine produces disciplined men. Men who can govern themselves before they attempt to lead others.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Healthy churches require mature men. Mature men are not defined by age or strength, but by self-control, integrity, and consistency.</p>
</div>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><strong>Titus 2:7-8</strong> in all things showing yourself to be a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing integrity, reverence, incorruptibility, 8 sound speech that cannot be condemned, that one who is an opponent may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of you. (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Now Paul turns to Titus himself. People learn not only by instruction but by example. People need leaders they can follow. Values are caught not just taught. Young men especially need fathers in the faith that they can follow.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“A pattern of good works”</span> means he is to be an example or visible model. Titus is not to preach what he does not practice. His life must demonstrate what he commands. True leaders lead in health and authenticity and in what they teach.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>“<span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">In doctrine showing integrity</span>.” His teaching must be whole, uncorrupted, unmixed with personal agenda. No trimming truth to fit culture. No softening edges to gain approval.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Reverence”</span> speaks of seriousness. Not harshness, but weight. The truth of God is not casual. It is handled with gravity.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Incorruptibility”</span> means purity that cannot be easily undermined. Both his life and his teaching must resist compromise.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Sound speech”</span> means healthy, wholesome words. Not reckless, not cutting, not careless, not harsh, or critical. Speech reveals what is in our heart. Our speech reveals our maturity.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Cannot be condemned”</span> does not mean no one will criticize or we don—t make mistakes.. It means there is no legitimate accusation of hypocrisy as our life and words align.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul mentions there will be opponents. There will be people who do not like being corrected, or do not like what is being taught. The goal is not to silence every critic, but to remove grounds for accusation. When conduct and speech are consistent with the gospel, people can criticize but without ground for it to land.—</p>
</div>
<div class="mtb-scripture">
<p><strong>Titus 2:9-10</strong> Exhort bondservants to be obedient to their own masters, to be well pleasing in all things, not answering back, 10 not pilfering, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things. (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul now moves to bondservants, another group that would have made up a visible portion of the church in Crete in those days.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>When Paul addresses bondservants, he is speaking into the social structure of the Roman world. Slavery in that context was widespread. Some were born into it. Some entered it through debt. Some were educated professionals. It was not identical to modern race-based slavery, and even though there were benefits in those days, it still involved involuntary servanthood and lack of freedom.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>So why does Paul address them this way?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>First, neither he nor the Bible endorses slavery, cruelty, or injustice. The gospel undermines slavery at its roots because we are all one and of equal value in Christ. In time, as Christianity spread, the evil idea of owning people was slowly dismantled.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>But here Paul is speaking pastorally to believers who are already in that structure of system. He is asking a deeper question: How does Christ follower live in a situation where they do not control his circumstances and who must endure injustice or difficulty?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Bondservants represent believers living under authority they did not choose and cannot easily change.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>And that applies far beyond the first century. Employees under difficult bosses. Workers in unfair companies. People trapped in poverty or constrained by circumstances they did not create. Those who feel overlooked, undervalued, or restricted. Anyone who wakes up each day inside a system not of their choosing.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul is not minimizing or legitimizing injustice. He is elevating the gospel and calling believers to be like Christ - to suffer and submit when necessary, trusting God for vindication and deliverance.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>The pressure point is obvious. When you feel trapped, powerless, undervalued, or feel like you deserve better, resentment rises. You justify ungodly attitudes and speech. You take shortcuts and justify unrighteous behavior.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul speaks directly into that instinct. Follow Jesus and carry your cross. Obey. Serve and work with excellence. Be respectful. Maintain integrity. Be faithful and work unto the Lord when no one is watching.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Why? <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“That they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.”</span> Paul says bondservants are to live in such a way that they adorn the doctrine of God. That word adorn is significant. It means to decorate, to make attractive, to display beautifully.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Exhort”</span> is strong language. It is not optional. The call to follow Jesus does not go away simply because we are in difficult circumstances. Rather it calls us higher. It confronts our self-will and calls us to be like Jesus.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Not answering back”</span> addresses a pressure point. When someone lives under authority, especially difficult authority, resentment can build. Sarcasm. Defiance. Subtle hostility. The tongue often reveals the heart—s complaining, ungrateful, resentment posture.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Not pilfering”</span> addresses another pressure point. When someone feels mistreated or undervalued, the temptation arises to take small liberties - a little dishonesty, a little justification (after all I deserve it). Paul forbids it outright. Our circumstances cannot be an excuse for disobedience or to stop follwign Jesus.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“Showing all good fidelity”</span> means complete trustworthiness. Reliable. Honest. Steady. The kind of person whose word and work can be trusted without supervision.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul is saying that even in positions of limited power or freedom, believers carry the reputation of God. A faithful worker under the most difficult circumstances and shine forth Jesus. The opposite, dishonesty, bitterness, complaining, or defiance make it unattractive.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>This section presses a deep truth. The gospel is not only proven in positions of leadership. It is proven in submission and difficult situations. It is proven in how a believer handles unfairness, pressure, and limited control. A faithful worker in a hard environment becomes living proof that Christ transforms the heart.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Healthy doctrine produces faithful workers. Faithful workers make Jesus visible in everyday life.</p>
</div>
