<p>So what kind of life makes the truth about Christ look beautiful?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Unselfish Life<br />
<br />
Titus 2:9—10 tells servants to be well pleasing in all things. That means they are not to focus on pleasing themselves, but to seek to please their masters first. Paul is telling them to live an unselfish life. Put others first. Think of others first. Consider what others need. Think about how your actions, what you do and do not do, affect others.<br />
<br />
This is radical in a system where you already feel deprived. The pressure point is obvious. When you feel you deserve better, selfishness feels justified. Paul says no. Die to self. Serve.<br />
<br />
We can clearly see why this adorns the gospel. It speaks volumes about Christ.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>It communicates God—s character. It shows forth the unselfishness of Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>It complements God—s nature. God is a giver. John 3:16 says, “For God so loved the world He gave.” He saves and benefits others through His unselfishness.</p></li>
<li><p>It causes Christ to be more attractive and desirable. In a world where unbelievers and many believers are supremely selfish, there is a God who is unselfish, and He is transforming a people to be unselfish as well. How many people could not love and want a God who is unselfish?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Submitted Life<br />
<br />
Titus 2:9 says servants are to be obedient to their own masters, not answering back. The word for obedient carries the idea of placing yourself under. Meaning willingly submitting yourself to all that is required of you, even when it feels unreasonable, so long as it is not immoral.<br />
<br />
Real inward submissiveness, because you have died and your life is now in Christ. Not forced, but natural, because you have died to self-will.<br />
<br />
Again, the pressure point is resentment. When someone has authority over you, especially imperfect authority, the instinct is to resist, to talk back, to push back. Paul addresses that directly.<br />
<br />
How does this adorn the gospel?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>It communicates Christ. Philippians 2 shows Him humbling Himself and becoming obedient.</p></li>
<li><p>It fits with God—s larger purpose to bring all things back under His authority. First Corinthians 15 speaks of all things being put under His feet.</p></li>
<li><p>It causes Christ to be more attractive. He is Lord. When your life reflects joyful submission to Him, it shows that you trust His rule.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Cheerful Life<br />
<br />
Titus 2:9 says to be well pleasing in all things. This goes beyond bare compliance. It means going beyond the call of duty. This speaks of proper disposition. An excellent attitude because you are serving God and because of all He has done.<br />
<br />
It is opposed to murmuring, complaining, self-pity, woe-is-me thinking, sourness, harshness. Instead, it is full of joy and love. God is in control. You are controlled by the Spirit of Christ.<br />
<br />
How does this adorn the gospel?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>It communicates the life of Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>It complements what Romans 14:17 says about the kingdom of God being righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.</p></li>
<li><p>It makes Christ attractive. No one wants the God of a sour, crabby, negative Christian. A joyful spirit in hard circumstances makes people ask why.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Life of Integrity</p></li>
<li><p>Titus 2:10 says not purloining. Slaves had ample opportunity to steal while their master was not watching.</p></li>
<li><p>The temptation to take small liberties when you feel mistreated is real. But Paul calls for honesty and integrity.</p></li>
<li><p>Living not under the pretense of man, but under the gaze of God. Living at all moments as if God is watching you, because He is.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrity is the same everywhere. Home. Office. Church. Children see the same you Sunday as Monday.</p></li>
<li><p>How does this adorn the gospel?</p></li>
<li><p>It communicates the conviction that there is a God who is omniscient, omnipresent, and judge.</p></li>
<li><p>It complements the nature of a holy God who requires a holy people.</p></li>
<li><p>It makes Christ more attractive because it proves we are not manipulating man-pleasers, but God-fearing believers.</p></li>
<li><p>E. Life That Is Faithful</p></li>
<li><p>Paul says to show all good fidelity. That means complete trustworthiness. Reliable. Steady. Faithful when no one is watching.</p></li>
<li><p>A faithful worker in a hard environment becomes living proof that Christ transforms the heart. Circumstances may remain imperfect, but character becomes compelling.</p></li>
<li><p>This is the bridge. Bondservant is not just a historical category. It represents every believer living under authority or limitation. The credibility of the gospel is visible precisely there.</p></li>
<li><p>The message of salvation must show up in the most ordinary, pressured, and constrained parts of life. That is where doctrine becomes undeniable. Every role becomes a stage where the character of Christ is either displayed or denied.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We see he Type of Life that Adorns or Beautifies the Truth we Profess to believe about Christ</p>
<p>Unselfish life:</p>
<p>To be well pleasing in all things” means seeking to do work in a way that reflects excellence and faithfulness. Not bare minimum compliance. Not passive resistance. Real effort.</p>
<p>“Bondservants” refers to those under authority, often with limited freedom. Paul does not begin by dismantling the structure. He begins by shaping the heart within it.</p>
<p>“To be obedient to their own masters” speaks of faithful responsiveness. Not blind moral compromise, but a posture of cooperation within legitimate authority. Christianity does not produce rebellion of spirit. It produces ordered strength.</p>
