<p>#Likewise, exhort the young men to be sober-minded,# [Titus 2:6 NKJV]</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>He tells Titus to “<strong>exhort</strong>” the young men. This is not casual advice. It is strong, intentional urging. Younger men are not to be left to figure out life for themselves. They are to be pressed toward maturity.</p>

<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Young men need fathers and other godly men in their life to provide strong guidance when they come of age. This speaks to the place of discipline and exhortation in discipling young men.</p>

<p>Paul differtiates between “sound” or healthy teaching vs teaching from the Bible. The Judiazers and false teachers were teaching from the Bible but because the teaching was not heathy, the fruit of the teaching, meaning the teachers and the believers was not healthy.</p>
<p>This raises a radical point. You can teach something found in the Bible, but it not be a healthy teaching. You can teach things from the word of God and be an unhealthy teacher.</p>
<p>The question becomes what constitutes “healthy teaching”. I believe Paul answers that first to Timothy and then to Titus.</p>
<p>The Word of God must be used to teach the purpose for which God gave His word.</p>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p><strong>1 Timothy 1:5</strong> <em>The purpose of my instruction is that all believers would be filled with love that comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and genuine faith.</em> (NLT-SE)</p>

<p>Heathy teaching does five things:</p>

</div></li>
</ol>
<p>If the word is used to promote arguments, strife, defend non-essential doctrines, or other-wise divide believers, in my view it is missing the purpose for which God gave us His Word.</p>
<p>The lesson is we need to be careful what we feed on from the Bible and where we feed from (who teaches us).</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Titus 2 shows that the gospel becomes attractive when it produces an unselfish, submitted, cheerful, faithful, and life of integrity, especially in places where we are not treated fairly, feel constrained, overlooked, mistreated, or convinced we deserve better.</p>

<h2 id="insight-six-marks-of-spiritual-maturity">Insight: Six Marks of Spiritual Maturity</h2>
<p>In <strong>Titus 2:2</strong>, Paul lists six qualities that should characterize these men. These aren't just personality traits; they are the results of sound doctrine incorporated into a life.</p>
<p>The list can be divided into two categories: <strong>Internal Restraint</strong> and <strong>External Faith.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Internal Restraint (Temperament)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sober-minded:</strong> This literally refers to being "temperate" or moderate in the use of wine, but it carries the broader meaning of being clear-headed. An older man should not be controlled by his physical appetites. They should be clear-headed, not ruled by appetite or impulse.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dignified:</strong> This means being worthy of respect. It doesn—t mean being "stiff" or "humorless," but rather having a serious-mindedness about life and faith that commands the respect of the younger generation. There is weight to their life, having walked decades with the Lord.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-controlled:</strong> This is a key word throughout Titus. It refers to a person who has mastery over their desires, impulses, thoughts, reactions, and speech.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. External Faith (The "Triple Threat" of Health)</strong></p>
<p>Paul concludes the verse by stating that these men must be <strong>"sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness."</strong> Note that he uses the word "sound" (healthy) again here.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sound in Faith:</strong> Their trust in God must be firm and free from the "sickness" of doubt or false teaching. They have unwaivering trust in God, regardless of trials or circumstances. Still bearing fruit in later years. No smell of “smoke— from going through life.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sound in Love:</strong> As men age, there is a natural tendency to become cynical or self-absorbed. Paul insists they must remain healthy in their active, selfless love for others. Also age has not cooled their passion for Jesus.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sound in Steadfastness (Patience):</strong> This is the ability to endure trials and the "long haul" of life without giving up. It is the "staying power" of a mature believer. It is endurance under pressure. The ability to handle trials and pressure well.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Maturity is not age or years in the faith, but manifest health in these areas.</p>
<h2 id="insight-we-all-need-teachers-and-models-to-grow-in-our-faith">Insight: We all need teachers and models to grow in our faith</h2>
<p>The Christian life is not natural. Believers are not born knowing how to live in a way that pleases God. Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Scripture is necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Instruction is necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Correction is necessary.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Without sound instruction and people to model a healthy, believers drift toward what “seems right,” which often leads to spiritual harm.</p>
<p>It is important to note the church of Crete was likely founded when believers carried the message back after the day of Pentecost and due to a lack of healthy teaching, the church, believers and families were unhealthy.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2 id="insight-our-tongues-can-be-the-devils-tool">Insight: Our tongues can be the devil—s tool</h2>
<p>In Titus 1:3, Paul tells Titus to teach the older women not to be “slanders”. The word behind this is actually the same word used for “devil” - the accuser.</p>
<p>Slander, Gossip and other sins of the mouth can be tools of the devil. Accusation, maligning others, criticizing others, and speaking about others is fellowshipping with the devil — joint participating in his mission of killing, stealing and destroying the body of Christ.</p>
<p>An easily solution is to determine to simply bring your complaint, concern, accusation , rumor to the person involved and speak directly to them, otherwise be slow to speak as James tells us or as Paul tells Titus, “not to slander.</p>
<p><strong>Insight: Young men need to be taught to be sensible</strong></p>
<p>Young men, while strong, have a tendency not to be sensible in decisions, behaviors, and reactions. You can spend a life-time paying for one moment of not being sensible. Young men need to be taught this.</p>
<p>Self-control and sensibility is not personality; it is Spirit-formed strength that prevents lifelong regret.</p>

<h2 id="insight-what-saving-grace-really-does">Insight — What Saving Grace Really Does</h2>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Saving grace is not merely God overlooking sin. It is God stepping down in Christ to rescue undeserving sinners who could expect nothing but judgment.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Grace means undeserved favor — freely given, without obligation, without expectation of return. But in the New Testament it rises higher than anything the Greeks imagined. God did not extend favor to friends. He gave His Son for enemies.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Saving grace brings salvation — and salvation is far more than fire insurance.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>It rescues us from the penalty of sin.<br />
It breaks the power of sin.<br />
It is removing the presence of sin.<br />
And it transfers our possession — we no longer belong to sin; we belong to God.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Grace does not merely pardon. It purifies, teaches, disciplines, transforms, and empowers,</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>It humbles the proud, destroys self-righteousness, removes the right to judge others, and keeps believers broken and dependent. It reminds us that salvation — past, present, and future — is wholly of God.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>And the same way we are saved is the way we are changed: grace received by faith.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Saving grace does not leave a man the same.<br />
It rescues him, reshapes him, and trains him to live for Christ.</p>
</div>
<p>If grace only forgives, Titus 2 becomes pressure. If grace empowers, Titus 2 becomes possible.</p>

<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Redemption is not only rescue from the penalty of sin.</p>

<p>Christ gave Himself to:</p>

Lawlessness is self-rule — living independent of God. Redemption is ransom. We were enslaved to sin and self. The cross did not merely pardon us; it bought us back. Grace breaks the dominion of rebellion.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>ΓÇó <span data-custom-style="Strong">To purify for Himself a people.</span><br />
Forgiveness removes guilt. Purification removes corruption. Christ did not die only to forgive us but to cleanse and claim us. We are His treasured possession — a people who belong wholly to Him.</p>

<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>ΓÇó <span data-custom-style="Strong">To produce zeal for good works.</span><br />
Redemption does not create minimal obedience. It produces burning eagerness to please Him. Good works are not the root of salvation, but they are the fruit of belonging.</p>

<p>Titus 2 makes this clear: the commands to maturity are not moral pressure. They are the outworking of a redeemed life.</p>
</div>

<p>Christ did not die merely to get us to heaven. He died to free us from lawlessness, cleanse us for Himself, and form in us a joyful zeal to live for Him.</p>

<h2 id="insight-the-pastors-mantle-authority-and-responsibility">Insight — The Pastor—s Mantle: Authority and Responsibility</h2>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Titus 2:15 reveals the weight of the pastoral mantle. The preacher—s mandate is to authoritatively communicate God—s Word so that it is understood, embraced, and obeyed. Paul commands Titus to <span data-custom-style="Strong">speak</span>, <span data-custom-style="Strong">exhort</span>, and <span data-custom-style="Strong">rebuke</span>, and to do so <span data-custom-style="Strong">with authority</span>. This authority is not personal dominance. It is derived from the Word of God. Where Scripture is clear, the pastor must be clear.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>To <span data-custom-style="Strong">speak</span> is to make the truth plain. To <span data-custom-style="Strong">exhort</span> is to urge hearts forward, pressing believers to live what they profess. To <span data-custom-style="Strong">rebuke</span> is to confront drift, expose compromise, and call people back into alignment with sound doctrine. Pastoral leadership therefore includes corrective clarity. Correction is not for humiliation but for restoration. It is meant to straighten what is crooked so health can return.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>Paul adds, “Let no one despise you,” because faithful preaching will not always be welcomed. People resist correction, change, and authority. Yet despising correction leads to disorder. Receiving it leads to health. Spiritual health in a church often flows from the integrity and courage of its leaders, and from a congregation willing to receive the Word with humility.</p>

<p><strong>Seeds — Truths Meant to Grow Over Time</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. The Blessed Hope</strong></p>
<p>Present endurance is sustained by eager expectation of the appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. Hope fuels holiness.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Triple Threat of Health</strong></p>
<p>Being sound in faith, love, and steadfastness becomes increasingly powerful over time. Spiritual health deepens rather than fades with age.</p>
<p><strong>3. Inward Purity Over Outward Religion</strong></p>
<p>Healthy doctrine produces purity of heart.<br />
Unhealthy doctrine replaces inward transformation with rituals, speculation, or man-made commands.</p>
<p><strong>4. Ordered Strength</strong></p>
<p>Submission under authority is not weakness. It is disciplined strength governed by Christ.</p>
<p><strong>5. Grace + Faith Is the Lifelong Pattern</strong></p>
<p>The way you were saved is the way you grow.<br />
Conviction ΓåÆ repentance ΓåÆ faith ΓåÆ grace.<br />
This pattern never becomes obsolete.</p>
<p><strong>6.Grace as Empowerment:</strong></p>
<p>If grace only forgives, Pau;—s instructions and commands become a pressure and burden; if grace empowers, a holy life becomes a joyful possibility.</p>
<p><strong>7. The Ordinary Becomes Sacred</strong></p>
<p>Homes, workplaces, and everyday routines are sacred spaces when your desire is to adorn the Gospel.</p>
<p><strong>8. Stand true what God has called you to do in Ministry</strong></p>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">

<p>Don—t fall prey to peer pressure, fear of man, comparison, espite what others are doing and saying, you keep teaching truth and do what you are called to do. Keep speaking the truth in a way that leads to spiritual health, ensuring that your teaching produces a life that matches what is believed.</p>

<li><p>Do I allow Scripture to correct me, or do I resist uncomfortable truth?</p></li>
<li><p>Have I reduced grace to forgiveness while resisting its training power?</p></li>
<li><p>Is my speech healthy and life-giving?</p></li>
