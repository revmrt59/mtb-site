<p>So what kind of life makes the truth about Christ look beautiful?</p>

<p>Unselfish Life<br />
<br />
Titus 2:9—10 tells servants to be well pleasing in all things. That means they are not to focus on pleasing themselves, but to seek to please their masters first. Paul is telling them to live an unselfish life. Put others first. Think of others first. Consider what others need. Think about how your actions, what you do and do not do, affect others.<br />
<br />
This is radical in a system where you already feel deprived. The pressure point is obvious. When you feel you deserve better, selfishness feels justified. Paul says no. Die to self. Serve.<br />
<br />
We can clearly see why this adorns the gospel. It speaks volumes about Christ.</p>

<p>It communicates God—s character. It shows forth the unselfishness of Christ.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>It complements God—s nature. God is a giver. John 3:16 says, “For God so loved the world He gave.” He saves and benefits others through His unselfishness.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>It causes Christ to be more attractive and desirable. In a world where unbelievers and many believers are supremely selfish, there is a God who is unselfish, and He is transforming a people to be unselfish as well. How many people could not love and want a God who is unselfish?</p>
</div></li>

<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Submitted Life<br />
<br />
Titus 2:9 says servants are to be obedient to their own masters, not answering back. The word for obedient carries the idea of placing yourself under. Meaning willingly submitting yourself to all that is required of you, even when it feels unreasonable, so long as it is not immoral.<br />
<br />
Real inward submissiveness, because you have died and your life is now in Christ. Not forced, but natural, because you have died to self-will.<br />
<br />
Again, the pressure point is resentment. When someone has authority over you, especially imperfect authority, the instinct is to resist, to talk back, to push back. Paul addresses that directly.<br />
<br />
How does this adorn the gospel?</p>
</div>
<ol type="a">
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>It communicates Christ. Philippians 2 shows Him humbling Himself and becoming obedient.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>It fits with God—s larger purpose to bring all things back under His authority. First Corinthians 15 speaks of all things being put under His feet.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>It causes Christ to be more attractive. He is Lord. When your life reflects joyful submission to Him, it shows that you trust His rule.</p>
</div></li>
</ol></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Cheerful Life<br />
<br />
Titus 2:9 says to be well pleasing in all things. This goes beyond bare compliance. It means going beyond the call of duty. This speaks of proper disposition. An excellent attitude because you are serving God and because of all He has done.<br />
<br />
It is opposed to murmuring, complaining, self-pity, woe-is-me thinking, sourness, harshness. Instead, it is full of joy and love. God is in control. You are controlled by the Spirit of Christ.<br />
<br />

<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>It complements what Romans 14:17 says about the kingdom of God being righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>It makes Christ attractive. No one wants the God of a sour, crabby, negative Christian. A joyful spirit in hard circumstances makes people ask why.</p>

<p>Life of Integrity</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Titus 2:10 says not purloining. Slaves had ample opportunity to steal while their master was not watching.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>The temptation to take small liberties when you feel mistreated is real. But Paul calls for honesty and integrity.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Living not under the pretense of man, but under the gaze of God. Living at all moments as if God is watching you, because He is.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Integrity is the same everywhere. Home. Office. Church. Children see the same you Sunday as Monday.</p>

<p>It communicates the conviction that there is a God who is omniscient, omnipresent, and judge.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>It complements the nature of a holy God who requires a holy people.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>It makes Christ more attractive because it proves we are not manipulating man-pleasers, but God-fearing believers.</p>

<p>E. Life That Is Faithful</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Paul says to show all good fidelity. That means complete trustworthiness. Reliable. Steady. Faithful when no one is watching.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>A faithful worker in a hard environment becomes living proof that Christ transforms the heart. Circumstances may remain imperfect, but character becomes compelling.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>This is the bridge. Bondservant is not just a historical category. It represents every believer living under authority or limitation. The credibility of the gospel is visible precisely there.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>The message of salvation must show up in the most ordinary, pressured, and constrained parts of life. That is where doctrine becomes undeniable. Every role becomes a stage where the character of Christ is either displayed or denied.</p>
</div></li>
</ol>
<p>We see he Type of Life that Adorns or Beautifies the Truth we Profess to believe about Christ</p>
<p>Unselfish life:</p>
<p>To be well pleasing in all things” means seeking to do work in a way that reflects excellence and faithfulness. Not bare minimum compliance. Not passive resistance. Real effort.</p>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>“Bondservants” refers to those under authority, often with limited freedom. Paul does not begin by dismantling the structure. He begins by shaping the heart within it.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>“To be obedient to their own masters” speaks of faithful responsiveness. Not blind moral compromise, but a posture of cooperation within legitimate authority. Christianity does not produce rebellion of spirit. It produces ordered strength.</p>
