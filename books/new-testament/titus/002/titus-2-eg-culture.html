<p><strong>East Gate Culture in Titus 2</strong></p>
<p>In Titus 2, Paul provides a clear framework for how the gospel creates a healthy, functional community. This chapter illustrates that when we live out our identity as sons and daughters, we become the place where heaven touches earth.</p>
<p><strong>HEALTH | From the Top Down and Inside Out</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Power of Sound Doctrine:</strong> We believe that healthy doctrine is the spiritual medicine that produces healthy lives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trickle-Down Health:</strong> Spiritual health spreads from the top down; if the older men and leaders are steady and "sound in faith," the entire church remains steady.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spiritual and Emotional Care:</strong> We are healthy when our thoughts, feelings, and desires are trained by grace to reflect God's heart.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXCELLENCE | Your Best, His Glory</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Unseen Integrity:</strong> We choose to do our best even when no one is watching, mirroring the "good fidelity" required of workers in the workplace.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adorning the Word:</strong> We strive for excellence in our daily work to "adorn the doctrine," making the truth of God attractive to everyone around us.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>His Worthiness:</strong> Our commitment to excellence is rooted in the fact that He is always worthy of our highest standard.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>COMMUNICATION | Real Talk for Real Relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verbal Clarity:</strong> Following Paul—s mandate to "speak," we choose to have 100% of our conversations with honesty and open hearts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Authenticity over Comfort:</strong> We "real talk" about the things people need to hear, even when it is awkward or causes opposition, because it leads to stronger relationships tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trust and Truth:</strong> Our relationships are built on the trust that comes from speaking things that are "proper for sound doctrine".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PEOPLE OF THE WORD | Foundations for Life</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Truth Walked Out:</strong> We believe that the Holy Scriptures are not just for reading but are meant to be walked out as a community.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Inerrant Foundation:</strong> We hold fast to the timeless Word of God as the only foundation that can correct disorder and bring people to maturity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Corporate Growth:</strong> As a people of the Word, we discuss and apply the Scriptures corporately to ensure every age group is "sound" and "stable".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AWAITING THE RETURN | Our Blessed Hope</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Great Motivation:</strong> Our desire for godliness is fueled by the "blessed hope"—the certain and glorious return of Jesus Christ.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ready for the Beloved:</strong> We live as a "special people," zealously preparing ourselves so that we are found ready when our Beloved returns.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expectant Preparation:</strong> It is our honor to live soberly and godly in this present age as we wait expectantly for Him to return for His bride.</p></li>

<p><strong>HEALTH | From the Top Down and Inside Out</strong></p>
<p>We believe that <strong>"Sound doctrine"</strong> produces healthy lives. Health spreads from the top down and from the inside out; if the leaders and older men are steady and <strong>"sound in faith,"</strong> the entire church remains steady. We are healthy when our thoughts, feelings, and desires are trained by grace to reflect God—s heart.</p>

<p><strong>EXCELLENCE | Your Best, His Glory</strong></p>
<p>We choose to do the best we can even when no one else is watching, mirroring the <strong>"good fidelity"</strong> required of workers in the workplace. Our commitment to excellence is rooted in the fact that He is always worthy of our highest standard. We live this way to <strong>"adorn the doctrine,"</strong> making the truth of God attractive to everyone around us.</p>

<p><strong>COMMUNICATION | Real Talk for Real Relationships</strong></p>
<p>Following the mandate to <strong>"speak"</strong> the things people need to hear, we choose to be authentic and open with one another. We “real talk” because we desire real relationships built on trust; we believe in being awkward today to be stronger tomorrow. We choose to communicate with <strong>"sound speech"</strong> that cannot be condemned, even when it causes opposition.</p>

<p><strong>PEOPLE OF THE WORD | Foundations for Life</strong></p>
<p>The foundation of our faith is the Holy Bible, and we hold fast to the inerrant and timeless Word of God. We believe the Holy Scriptures are to be read individually, discussed corporately, and <strong>"walked out"</strong> as a community. We live out the truth so that <strong>"the word of God may not be blasphemed"</strong> by an inconsistent life.</p>
<p>+3</p>
<p><strong>AWAITING THE RETURN | Our Blessed Hope</strong></p>
<p>Our greatest desire is to be found ready when our Beloved returns. We live <strong>"sober-minded"</strong> in this present age, fueled by the <strong>"blessed hope"</strong>—the certain and glorious return of Jesus Christ. It is our <strong>"HONOR"</strong> to prepare and wait expectantly for Him as a people purified for His own possession.</p>
