<p><strong>SLANDERERS</strong> — (<em>diabolos</em>, Strong—s G1228) Refers to those who are prone to defamation, backbiting, or malicious gossip. It describes a "bad eye" that sees and speaks darkness instead of light, functioning as an adversary to the "sound doctrine" that builds up the body.</p>
<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> Derived from <em>diaballì</em>, which means "to throw across" or "to strike through". It carries the idea of "throwing" a accusation or a lie at someone to pierce their reputation.</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> A slanderer, a false accuser, or a person given to finding fault. When used as a noun with the definite article, it is the title for the Devil, the arch-accuser.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Archer's Dart:</strong> In secular Greek, it pictured someone standing at a distance and "throwing" words like arrows to wound a person who wasn't there to defend themselves.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Divider:</strong> It was used to describe a person who intentionally "threw" a wedge of gossip between two friends to split them apart.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of someone spreading "spiritual poison" in a well; the word <em>diabolos</em> describes the one who ruins the "sound" health of a community by infecting it with accusations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> To be a <strong>slanderer</strong> is to act in alignment with the character of the enemy rather than the character of God. Since God is "infinitely good" and "loves humanity immeasurably," our words should reflect His heart of "redemptive intent" rather than the "death" produced by malicious talk.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:3</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“the older women likewise, that they be reverent in behavior, not slanderers (diabolos)...”</strong></em>. Paul warns older women against this specifically because their words carry great weight; if they use that weight to "strike through" others with gossip, they become "unhealthy" and "unbecoming" of the Gospel.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 3:11:</strong> <em><strong>“Likewise, their wives must be reverent, not slanderers (diabolos), temperate, faithful in all things.”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 3:3:</strong> <em><strong>“unloving, unforgiving, slanderers (diabolos), without self-control, brutal, despisers of good,”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>John 6:70:</strong> <em><strong>“Jesus answered them, 'Did I not choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil (diabolos)?'”</strong></em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> In the ancient world, "not being a slanderer" was a mark of a "safe" person. For the older woman, her mouth must be a "spiritual container" that carries life and "nourishes the inner man" rather than a weapon of destruction.</p>
