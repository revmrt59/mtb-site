<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> A primary verb. It is one of the most fundamental words in the Greek language for the act of "giving" in all its forms, from handing over an object to "sacrificing" a life.</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> To give, bestow, or deliver. In this context, it carries the weight of a "proper" and "decisive" self-offering. It is the "action" of the Master becoming a "bondservant" (<em>doulos</em>) to set the slaves free. It denotes a "meaning integrity" where the love of God is not just a "theory" but a tangible "spiritual revelation."</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Bestowed Gift:</strong> In secular Greek, it was used for a king "giving" a decree or a benefactor "giving" a gift to a city. It was an act that established a "reputable" relationship between the giver and the receiver.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Yielded Territory:</strong> It pictured a general "giving up" or "delivering" a position or himself into the hands of another.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a hand being opened wide; it is the opposite of "pilfering" (<em>nosphizomai</em>), which takes for self. <strong>"Gave"</strong> is the "unblemished" openness of God—s heart, pouring out "nourishment" for the "inner man" through the "sacred beauty" of the Cross.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> The "gift" is the "functional" foundation of the Gospel. Since God is "infinitely good," His "action" toward a "leprous" world was to <strong>"give"</strong> Himself. This "safe" and "sound" sacrifice provides the "internal hygiene" necessary for our salvation. To be "wholly His" is only possible because He first gave Himself "wholly" for us. It is the "sacred fitness" of a Savior who holds nothing back.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:14</strong> The NKJV says: <em>“who gave (didìmi) Himself for us, that He might redeem us...”</em> Paul emphasizes the voluntary nature of the act. Christ was not "taken"; He "gave." This "proper" sacrifice is the reason we must live "soberly, righteously, and godly." The "spiritual container" of our lives is now "reproducible" in His image because He "gave" us the "pattern" through His own blood.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Matthew 20:28:</strong> <em>“...and to give (didìmi) His life a ransom for many.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>John 3:16:</strong> <em>“For God so loved the world that He gave (didìmi) His only begotten Son...”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Galatians 1:4:</strong> <em>“who gave (didìmi) Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from this present evil age...”</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "transparency" of divine love. To "give" is the "aesthetic" of heaven. By remembering that He <em>didìmi</em> Himself, the believer is "shielded" from the "unhealthy" pride of the "leprous king of self." It ensures that our walk on the "Highway of Holiness" is always a response to His "infinitely good" and "sound" generosity.</p>
