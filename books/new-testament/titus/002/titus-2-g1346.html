<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> The adverbial form of <em>dikaios</em> (just, righteous), which comes from <em>dikô</em> (a judicial verdict or right). It describes the <em>manner</em> in which a person conducts their affairs.</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> Justly, uprightly, or in a right manner. It denotes a life lived in "proper" alignment with what is right in the sight of God and man. It is the "functional" evidence of a heart that has been made "sound" by grace.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Straight Path:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>dikaiìs</em> was used to describe a path that was "straight" and "level." It didn't "deviate" into the "unhealthy" ditches of dishonesty or partiality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Honest Merchant:</strong> It pictured a businessman who used "accurate" weights and measures; his transactions were <em>dikaiìs</em> because they were transparent and "safe" for the customer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a plumb line used in construction; a wall built <em>dikaiìs</em> is perfectly vertical. It represents the "meaning integrity" of a life that is "squared" to the truth of the Word.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Righteousness is the "sacred fitness" of the believer—s social life. Since God is "infinitely good," our dealings with others must be "unblemished" by selfishness or fraud. To live <strong>"righteously"</strong> is to show that the "internal hygiene" of the soul has resulted in an "external order." It is the refusal to let the "leprous king of self" cheat or mistreat others on the "Highway of Holiness."</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:12</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“...we should live soberly, righteously (dikaiìs), and godly in the present age,”</strong></em>. While "soberly" deals with the <strong>internal</strong> world, "righteously" deals with the <strong>external</strong> world—the believer—s relationship with their neighbor. It is the "action" of grace that ensures the believer is "reputable" in all their human interactions.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Corinthians 15:34:</strong> <em>“Awake to righteousness (dikaiìs), and do not sin; for some do not have the knowledge of God.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Peter 2:23:</strong> <em>“...but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously (dikaiìs);”</em> (Referring to the "sound" judgment of God).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "transparency" of the Christian walk. To live <em>dikaiìs</em> is to ensure that our "spiritual container" is not leaking through acts of injustice. It is a "reproducible" testimony that grace transforms the "unhealthy" sinner into a "just" citizen, making the Gospel "becoming" to everyone who observes the believer—s life.</p>
