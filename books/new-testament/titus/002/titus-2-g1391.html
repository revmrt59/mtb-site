<p><strong>GLORIOUS</strong> — (<em>doxa</em>, Strong—s G1391) Refers to majesty, splendor, and the manifest weight of God's "infinitely good" character. In this context, it describes the "shining" quality of Christ—s return—a "spiritual revelation" of His absolute "reputable" nature that will fill the universe with "sacred beauty."</p>
<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> Derived from the verb <em>dokeì</em>, meaning "to think" or "to seem." Originally, it meant an opinion or a reputation (what people "thought" of someone), but in the New Testament, it is elevated to describe the objective, "sound" reality of God—s splendor.</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> Brightness, splendor, or majesty. It denotes the "meaning integrity" of God—the outward manifestation of His internal "internal hygiene" and holiness. It is the "sacred fitness" of the Divine nature made visible.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Radiance of the Sun:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>doxa</em> was used for the "shining" light of celestial bodies. It was the "proper" way the sun expressed its "sound" nature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The King—s Robes:</strong> It pictured the weight and "aesthetic" of a monarch—s presence. When a king entered a room, his <em>doxa</em> was the "visible proof" of his authority.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a diamond held up to the light; the "glorious" flashes of color are the <em>doxa</em>. They don't change what the diamond <em>is</em>, they reveal its "unblemished" quality. <strong>"Glorious"</strong> is the "reproducible" light of God—s essence.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Glory is the "aesthetic" of heaven. Since God is "infinitely good," His presence is naturally "glorious." To look for a <strong>"glorious"</strong> appearing is to recognize that the "leprous" darkness of the current age is not the final word. It is the "action" of the soul reaching for the "sacred beauty" that is "wholly His." This glory is "sound" because it provides the ultimate "nourishment" for the believer's hope.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:13</strong> The NKJV says: <em>“...looking for the blessed hope and glorious (doxa) appearing...”</em> (The Greek literally reads "the appearing of the glory"). Paul shows that the "appearing" (<em>epiphainì</em>) of grace in verse 11 is answered by the "appearing" of <em>glory</em> here. This "sound" transition from grace to glory is the "proper" goal of the "Highway of Holiness."</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Luke 2:9:</strong> <em>“...and the glory (doxa) of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>John 1:14:</strong> <em>“And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory (doxa)...”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Corinthians 3:18:</strong> <em>“...are being transformed into the same image from glory (doxa) to glory (doxa)...”</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "transparency" of God's character. When Christ returns, there will be no more "unhealthy" shadows or "diseased" doubts; everything will be seen in the light of His <em>doxa</em>. By "adorning" the doctrine now, the believer acts as a "spiritual container" that reflects a small portion of that "sacred beauty" to a world that is still in the dark.</p>
