<p><strong>HOPE</strong> — (<em>elpis</em>, Strong—s G1680) Refers to a confident, joyful expectation of good. Unlike the worldly "wish," this is a "sound" and "safe" certainty based on the "infinitely good" character of God, serving as the "spiritual anchor" for the believer—s soul.</p>
<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> Derived from the root <em>elpì</em>, meaning "to anticipate" or "to welcome." It is a primary noun.</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> Expectation of good; confidence; trust. It denotes a settled "meaning integrity" where the future is viewed as "properly" secure because of God's promise. It is the "functional" opposite of despair.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Anchor of the Ship:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>elpis</em> was often compared to the anchor of a ship. Even if the surface of the water was "unhealthy" and storm-tossed, the anchor provided a "sound" connection to the solid ground below.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Sower—s Wait:</strong> It pictured the farmer who sows seed in the "sacred beauty" of the earth and waits with <em>elpis</em> for the harvest; his current "action" is governed by his "proper" confidence in the future fruit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a bridge extending across a deep chasm. You cannot see the far side clearly through the mist, but you walk across it with <em>elpis</em> because you know the structure is "reputable" and "sound."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Hope is the "internal hygiene" of the heart. Since God is "infinitely good," the believer—s future is not a "leprous" uncertainty but a "sacred fitness." To have <strong>"hope"</strong> is the "spiritual revelation" that the "appearing" (<em>epiphainì</em>) of Christ in the past guarantees His "appearing" in the future. It is the "nourishment" that allows the believer to walk the "Highway of Holiness" with a "safe mind."</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:13</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“looking for the blessed hope (elpis) and glorious appearing...”</strong></em> Paul pairs <em>elpis</em> with "blessed." This "sound" hope is what motivates the "proper" conduct described in the previous verses. If the "spiritual container" of the soul is filled with this hope, the "unhealthy" desires of the world lose their power.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Romans 5:5:</strong> <em>“Now hope (elpis) does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts...”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Colossians 1:27:</strong> <em>“...which is Christ in you, the hope (elpis) of glory.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hebrews 6:19:</strong> <em>“This hope (elpis) we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast...”</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "transparency" of our trust in God. To live with <em>elpis</em> is to be a "reproducible" testimony of the Gospel—s power. It ensures that even in "unhealthy" circumstances, the believer—s "sacred beauty" remains intact because they are "wholly His" and looking toward an "infinitely good" finish.</p>
