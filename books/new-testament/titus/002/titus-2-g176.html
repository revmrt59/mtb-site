<p><strong>CANNOT BE CONDEMNED</strong> — (<em>akatagnìstos</em>, Strong—s G176) Refers to something that is beyond reproach or "un-blameable." It describes a life and speech so "sound" and "transparent" that even an enemy searching for a flaw can find no legitimate basis for an accusation.</p>
<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> A compound word formed from <em>a</em> (not), <em>kata</em> (against), and <em>ginìskì</em> (to know). It literally means "not to be known against" or "irreprehensible."</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> That which cannot be condemned; not open to just censure. It denotes a quality of "meaning integrity" that is so solid it is "accusation-proof." It is not that people won't try to condemn it, but that the condemnation will not "stick" because there is no "decay" to find.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Legal Verdict:</strong> In secular Greek, it was used for a legal case or a person that was so clearly "proper" and "just" that a judge could find no grounds to even bring a charge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Shield without a Crack:</strong> It pictured a piece of armor that was so well-forged that a critic's "arrow" (accusation) would simply bounce off without finding a way to "pierce" the person.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a window that has been cleaned so thoroughly that there is no "mixture" of dust or streaks; it is <em>akatagnìstos</em> because anyone looking through it sees only the light, with no "flaw" to point out.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Because God is "infinitely good," His representatives should live in a way that reflects His "unblemished" character. To be <strong>"beyond condemnation"</strong> is the "functional" goal of a life that is "wholly His." It ensures that the "Highway of Holiness" is not brought into disrepute by "unhealthy" behavior. It is the "sacred fitness" of a life that leaves the adversary "empty-handed."</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:8</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“sound speech that cannot be condemned (akatagnìstos), that one who is an opponent may be ashamed...”</strong></em>. Paul emphasizes that "sound speech" acts as the "spiritual container" for the Gospel. If the speech is "beyond condemnation," the message remains "safe" and "protected" from the "blasphemy" of the culture.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This specific word (<em>akatagnìstos</em>) appears <strong>only here</strong> in the New Testament. Its rarity highlights the high standard of "vocal hygiene" Paul required for Titus as a leader.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "shielding" power of a "proper" life. It is the "action" of living so transparently that your "reputable" nature is undeniable. When a believer is <em>akatagnìstos</em>, they "adorn the doctrine" by making it "sound" and "reproducible" to others, effectively silencing the "leprous" accusations of the world.</p>
