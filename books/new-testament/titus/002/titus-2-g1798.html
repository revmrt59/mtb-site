<p><strong>ASHAMED</strong> — (<em>entrepō</em>, Strong’s G1798) Refers to being turned inward or "blushing" with a sense of shame. In this context, it describes the reaction of an opponent who, after looking for a flaw in a believer's life, finds none and is forced to "retreat" into a state of embarrassment because their accusations have no "sound" basis.</p>
<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> Derived from <em>en</em> (in) and <em>trepō</em> (to turn). It literally means "to turn in upon oneself."</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> To put to shame, to cause to blush, or to make one "turn away" out of respect or embarrassment. It describes a psychological shift where a person's outward attack is turned back on them, forcing them to look at their own "unhealthy" motives.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Defeated Opponent:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>entrepō</em> was used for a wrestler or soldier who was so completely outmatched that they "turned away" from the fight in humiliation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Reverent Child:</strong> It also described the way a child "turns inward" or bows in the presence of a superior—showing "reverence" or respect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a person who shouts a lie in a quiet room, only to have the truth suddenly and undeniably revealed; the resulting silence and "downward look" of the accuser is the state of being <em>entrepō</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> The Gospel has a "silencing" power. When a believer's life is "sound" and "proper," it acts as a "spiritual mirror" that reflects the opponent's own "sickness" back to them. To make the enemy <strong>"ashamed"</strong> is not about prideful victory, but about protecting the "meaning integrity" of the Word. It proves that the "Highway of Holiness" is real and that those who walk it are "wholly His."</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:8</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“...that one who is an opponent may be ashamed (entrepō), having nothing evil to say of you.”</strong></em> Paul identifies this as the "functional" result of "sound speech." If the opponent's "bad eye" can find no "rot" in the believer, their mouth is shut. Their "shame" is the evidence that the believer's "sacred fitness" has successfully shielded the Gospel.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Matthew 21:37:</strong> <em><strong>“Then last of all he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect (entrepō) my son.’”</strong></em> (Here, the "turning inward" is the positive form of reverence).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Corinthians 4:14:</strong> <em><strong>“I do not write these things to shame (entrepō) you, but as my beloved children I warn you.”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Thessalonians 3:14:</strong> <em><strong>“...do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed (entrepō).”</strong></em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "repelling" power of holiness. It is the "action" that ensures the "leprous king of self" (whether in us or in our critics) is defeated. When an opponent is <em>entrepō</em>, the "reproducible" beauty of a "sound" life has won the argument without saying a word. It leaves the adversary with "nothing evil to say," which is the ultimate "internal hygiene" for the church's reputation.</p>
