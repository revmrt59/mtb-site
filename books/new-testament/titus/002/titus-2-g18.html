<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> A primary word. It describes goodness in the broadest sense—as a quality that is both excellent in itself and beneficial in its effect.</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> Good, pleasant, excellent, or distinguished. In the New Testament, it often refers to a "benevolent goodness"—a quality that moves beyond mere "correctness" to reach out in kindness and service.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Fertile Soil:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>agathos</em> was used for soil that was "good" because it was capable of producing a rich, life-sustaining harvest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Skilled Physician:</strong> It described a doctor who was "good" not just because he knew medicine, but because his work actually restored the health of the patient.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a fruit tree that is heavy with ripe fruit; it is <em>agathos</em> because its internal health results in something that nourives and delights anyone who approaches it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> True goodness is an attribute of God. To be "good" in this sense is to reflect the "infinitely good" nature of the Father. It is a manifestation of the Holy Spirit, proving that a person is "wholly His." This goodness is "functional"—it works to repair what is broken and to "nourish the inner man" of those within the believer's sphere of influence.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:5</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“to be discreet, chaste, homemakers, good (agathos), obedient...”</strong></em>. Paul includes this to ensure that the young woman's management of the home is not harsh or cold. Her "soundness" must be seasoned with a kindness that makes the "sound doctrine" attractive and "becoming" to her family.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Matthew 7:17:</strong> <em><strong>“Even so, every good (agathos) tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Galatians 5:22:</strong> <em><strong>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness (agathosyne—the noun form), faithfulness,”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ephesians 2:10:</strong> <em><strong>“For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good (agathos) works...”</strong></em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> In the "Mastering the Bible" framework, being <em>agathos</em> is the "overflow" of a life that has received the "goodness of God." It is the refusal to be "stagnant." A "good" woman is a "spiritual container" of grace, ensuring that her home is a place where "heaven's value" is felt through her deeds and her disposition.</p>
