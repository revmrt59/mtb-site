<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><strong>APPEARED</strong> — (<em>epiphainō</em>, Strong’s G2014) Refers to a sudden breaking forth of light or a visible manifestation. It describes the historic moment when God’s grace—previously hidden in shadows and types—became "shiningly" visible in the person and work of Jesus Christ, bringing the "sound" hope of salvation to all humanity.</p>
<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> A compound word formed from <em>epi</em> (upon) and <em>phainō</em> (to shine or to give light). It is the root of the English word "epiphany."</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> To bring to light, to become visible, or to shine upon. It denotes a manifestation that is so bright and clear that it cannot be ignored. It carries the sense of a definitive "entrance" into a dark space.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Rising Sun:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>epiphainō</em> was the standard word for the sun rising at dawn, "breaking through" the darkness of night to illuminate the earth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Imperial Visit:</strong> It was used to describe the arrival of a king or emperor to a city; his "appearing" brought a sudden change to the atmosphere, often resulting in gifts or clemency for the citizens.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a beacon light being switched on in the middle of a storm; it doesn't just "exist"—it "appears" with the specific purpose of providing a "safe" direction for those who are lost.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Grace is not a "secret" doctrine; it is a "revealed" Person. The <strong>"appearing"</strong> of grace is the definitive proof that God is "infinitely good" and "loves humanity immeasurably." It is the "spiritual revelation" that marks the end of the "unhealthy" darkness of sin and the beginning of the "Highway of Holiness." This appearance is "sound" because it provides a visible "pattern" for how humanity is to live.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:11</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared (epiphainō) to all men,”</strong></em>. Paul uses this word to provide the "theological fuel" for the instructions he just gave. The reason older women, young men, and servants can live "properly" is that the "shining light" of grace has already broken into history to empower them.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Luke 1:79:</strong> <em><strong>“To give light (epiphainō) to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death...”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Titus 3:4:</strong> <em><strong>“But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared (epiphainō),”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acts 27:20:</strong> <em><strong>“Now when neither sun nor stars appeared (epiphainō) for many days...”</strong></em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "transparency" of God’s plan. Grace is "properly" displayed for everyone to see. It is the "action" of God reaching down to "nourish the inner man" by making Himself known. Because grace has <em>epiphainō</em>, our lives are now called to <em>kosmeō</em> (adorn) that light, ensuring the "sacred beauty" of the Gospel remains visible in our conduct.</p>
