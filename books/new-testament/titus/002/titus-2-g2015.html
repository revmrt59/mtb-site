<p><strong>APPEARING</strong> — (<em>epiphaneia</em>, Strong’s G2015) Refers to a visible manifestation, a "shining forth," or a sudden arrival. In this context, it describes the literal, glorious return of Jesus Christ—a "sound" and "infinitely good" event where the "sacred beauty" of the King is unveiled for all to see.</p>
<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> Derived from <em>epiphanēs</em> (conspicuous/manifest), which comes from <em>epiphainō</em> (<em>epi</em>, "upon" and <em>phainō</em>, "to shine"). It is the noun form of the verb used in Titus 2:11.</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> An appearing, manifestation, or "shining forth." In the New Testament, it almost exclusively refers to the "proper" and "reputable" entrance of Christ into the human sphere—either His first advent (in grace) or His second advent (in glory).</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Royal Arrival:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>epiphaneia</em> was the technical term for a visit from a king or emperor to a city (<em>adventus</em>). The "appearing" of the sovereign brought a "spiritual revelation" of his power and often resulted in the "nourishment" of the city through gifts or favor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Dawn of Day:</strong> It pictured the moment the sun "breaks through" the horizon, making the "unhealthy" darkness of night vanish instantly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a stage curtain being pulled back; the actors were always there, but the <em>epiphaneia</em> is the moment they are "made visible" to the audience. <strong>"Appearing"</strong> is the "functional" reveal of the "sacred fitness" of God's plan.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> The "appearing" is the "meaning integrity" of Christian hope. Since grace has already "appeared" (<em>epiphainō</em>, v. 11), the believer lives with the "safe mind" that glory will also "appear" (<em>epiphaneia</em>, v. 13). It is the "action" of God concluding the "Highway of Holiness" with a visible victory. It proves that the "leprous" state of the world is temporary and that the "infinitely good" God is the final Auditor of history.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:13</strong> The NKJV says: <em>“...looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing (epiphaneia) of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,”</em>. Paul uses this word to provide a "sound" target for our "looking." Our conduct (v. 12) is "proper" because we are preparing for a literal "shining forth" of our Master. This "spiritual container" of expectation keeps the believer "unblemished" by the world.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>2 Thessalonians 2:8:</strong> <em>“...whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth and destroy with the brightness (epiphaneia) of His coming.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 6:14:</strong> <em>“that you keep this commandment without spot, blameless until our Lord Jesus Christ’s appearing (epiphaneia),”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 4:8:</strong> <em>“...but also to all those who have loved His appearing (epiphaneia).”</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "transparency" of the Gospel. The first "appearing" was in humility; the second will be in <em>doxa</em> (glory). To love His <em>epiphaneia</em> is the "internal hygiene" of the saint. It ensures that our "reproducible" walk on the "Highway of Holiness" is fueled by the "sacred beauty" of a King who is not just a "theory," but a "shining" reality who is coming back.</p>
