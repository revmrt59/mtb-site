<p><strong>GODLY</strong> — (<em>eusebōs</em>, Strong’s G2170) Refers to living with a deep sense of reverence, devotion, and piety toward God. It describes the <strong>upward</strong> focus of a "sound" life, where every action is a "spiritual revelation" of a heart that is "wholly His."</p>
<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> The adverbial form of <em>eusebēs</em>, derived from <em>eu</em> (well) and <em>sebomai</em> (to worship or revere). It describes the <em>manner</em> in which a person relates to the Divine.</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> Piously, religiously, or in a godly manner. It denotes a life lived with "proper" respect for God's presence. It is the opposite of <em>asebeia</em> (ungodliness), representing the "internal hygiene" of a soul that is "right-facing" toward its Creator.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Devout Worshiper:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>eusebōs</em> was used for a person who fulfilled all their duties to the gods and their parents with "unblemished" sincerity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Hallowed Atmosphere:</strong> It pictured the "sacred beauty" of a temple service where everything is done "decently and in order."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a flower that always turns its face toward the sun; it lives <em>eusebōs</em> because its entire "utility" and growth are governed by the light it constantly acknowledges.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Godliness is the "sacred fitness" of the soul in relation to God. Since God is "infinitely good," a "sound" life must be characterized by an "upward" devotion. To live <strong>"godly"</strong> is the "action" of keeping the "East Gate" of the heart open to God's influence. It proves that the "leprous king of self" has been dethroned by a "safe mind" that recognizes the "meaning integrity" of God’s holiness.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:12</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“...we should live soberly, righteously, and godly (eusebōs) in the present age,”</strong></em>. Paul completes his triad of adverbs: "soberly" (internal), "righteously" (external), and "godly" (upward). This "proper" balance ensures the believer is "wholly His" in every dimension of existence.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 3:12:</strong> <em>“Yes, and all who desire to live godly (eusebōs) in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.”</em></p></li>
<li><p>This specific adverb (<em>eusebōs</em>) appears <strong>only twice</strong> in the New Testament (here and in 2 Timothy), though its noun form (<em>eusebeia</em>) is used extensively to describe the "power" of the Christian life.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "transparency" of our devotion. Living <em>eusebōs</em> is the refusal to let the "unhealthy" values of the "present age" obscure our view of God. It is the "functional" result of grace "teaching" us to value the "sacred" over the "common," ensuring our "spiritual container" is always positioned to receive from the "infinitely good" Father.</p>
