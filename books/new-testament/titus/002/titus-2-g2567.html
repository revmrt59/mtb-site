<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Master Artisan:</strong> In ancient education, a <em>kalodidaskalos</em> was someone who taught an apprentice to produce work that was not only functional but aesthetically "beautiful" (<em>kalos</em>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Ethical Mentor:</strong> It described someone who took responsibility for the moral development of the younger generation, ensuring they understood what was "noble" in society.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a gardener showing a child how to tend a prize rose; the "teacher of good things" shows how to cultivate a life that is attractive and "proper" in the eyes of God.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Teaching is not limited to a pulpit; it is a life-giving transaction. Because God is "infinitely good," those who belong to Him are called to be "wholly His" in how they impart wisdom. This word reveals that the older women are authorized by God to "form" the character of the younger generation by pointing them toward the "sacred beauty" of a life lived in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:3</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“the older women likewise... teachers of good things (kalodidaskalos),”</strong></em>. Paul uses this unique word to elevate the role of the older women. Since they are to be "reverent in behavior," their "teaching" is the natural overflow of their "sacred fitness." They aren't just teaching rules; they are teaching the "good things" of the Gospel.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This specific compound word (<em>kalodidaskalos</em>) appears <strong>only here</strong> in the New Testament. Its uniqueness highlights the specific "mentoring" mandate Paul gives to women in the church.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This term emphasizes the <strong>attractiveness</strong> of holiness. The "good things" being taught are not heavy burdens, but the "nourishing" truths that produce "soundness" in the home and the church. For the older woman, her life is the "reproducible" model that makes the "sound doctrine" of Titus 2:1 visible and practical.</p>
