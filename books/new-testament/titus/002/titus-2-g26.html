<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Greek Roots / Derivation:</strong> The noun form of the verb <em>agapaì</em>. It describes a love that is a deliberate choice of the will.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meaning / Lexical Definition:</strong> Benevolence, good will, and esteemed love. It is the divine love of God which is bestowed upon the unworthy and is demonstrated most fully in the cross.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Unconditional Choice</strong>: In secular Greek, <em>agapô</em> was used to describe the "highest" form of love because it does not depend on the character of the person being loved.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Royal Feast</strong>: It was later used to describe the "love feast" of the early church.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image</strong>: Think of a mother—s tireless care for a child who cannot repay her; it is a love that pours out because it is its nature to give.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Theological Implications:</strong> To be <strong>"sound in love"</strong> means our capacity to love is healthy and free from the "sickness" of selfishness. It is the fruit of receiving the "intoxicating love" of the Bridegroom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:2:</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“that the older men be... sound in faith, in love (agapô)...”</strong></em>. Paul emphasizes this so that older men—s maturity is characterized by sacrifice rather than just cold information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>John 3:16</strong>: <em><strong>“For God so loved (agapaì) the world that He gave His only begotten Son...”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Corinthians 13:13</strong>: <em><strong>“And now abide faith, hope, love (agapô), these three; but the greatest of these is love.”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 John 4:8</strong>: <em><strong>“He who does not love does not know God, for God is love (agapô).”</strong></em></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Relevant Insights:</strong> This love is "Through His Eyes"—ascribing heaven—s value to the people around us. It is the natural "manifestation" of a life that has been "undone" by the goodness of God.</p></li>
