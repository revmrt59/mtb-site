<p><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong> — (<em>katastôma</em>, Strong—s G2688) Refers to a person's entire physical and moral bearing, including their posture, dress, and conduct. It describes the outward manifestation of an inner state, where one's life is so settled in God that their very presence reflects a "sacred fitness".</p>
<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> Derived from <em>kathistômi</em>, which means "to set in order" or "to appoint". It carries the idea of a settled state or a permanent condition of being.</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> The state of being, demeanor, or deportment. It encompasses the whole manner of life, including outward appearance and the way one carries themselves in public.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Actor—s Costume and Role:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>katastôma</em> was used for an actor—s "costume" and "bearing"—the way they presented themselves to be recognized as their character.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Settled Weather:</strong> It described a stable, calm condition of the atmosphere or weather that was "set in order".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a soldier who is "at attention"; their <em>katastôma</em> is their disciplined posture that tells everyone they are on duty and under authority.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Behavior is not just a list of "do's and don'ts"; it is the outward "vessel" of a spiritual reality. This word reveals that our "settled state" should be one of holiness, where our physical presence is an "invitation into a deeper walk with God".</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:3</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“the older women likewise, that they be reverent in behavior (katastôma)...”</strong></em>. Paul is highlighting that an older woman's very presence should carry a "priestly" weight, where her dress and demeanor match the "sacred" character (<em>hieroprepôs</em>) she holds in Christ.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This specific word (<em>katastôma</em>) appears only here in the New Testament. Its rarity emphasizes the specific, holistic "posture of life" Paul is calling for in the older women.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> In the "Mastering the Bible" framework, this word represents the "natural" functioning as a "spiritual revelation". It is the "action" of a life that is "wholly His"—where the internal reality of being "sound" is clearly visible in the outward bearing.</p>
