<p><strong>YOUNG WOMEN</strong> — (<em>neos</em>, Strong’s G3501) Refers to those who are new to a stage of life, particularly those who are youthful or in the early years of marriage and motherhood. It describes a group that is in need of "sound" mentoring to ensure their lives are "proper" for the Gospel as they manage their new responsibilities.</p>
<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> A primary word. It carries the root idea of "newness" or "freshness."</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> New, young, or youthful. In the New Testament, when used of people, it refers to the younger generation. In this specific context, it identifies the women who are the primary focus of the "admonishing" or training provided by the older women.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The New Wine:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>neos</em> was the word used for "new wine" that was still fermenting and had not yet "settled."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Fresh Soil:</strong> It was used for land that was being cultivated for the first time—it had great potential but needed careful "forming" to produce a good harvest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a young sapling; it is full of life and growing rapidly, but it is also flexible and easily influenced by the wind. It needs a "stake" (the mentoring of the older women) to ensure it grows straight and strong.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Youth is a season of "becoming." While the world often views the "new" or "young" as the standard of beauty, the Bible views it as a season that requires "sound" instruction to avoid "unhealthy" patterns. The goal for the <em>neos</em> woman is to move from the "unsettled" nature of youth into the "sound-mindedness" of a life that is "wholly His."</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:4</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“that they admonish the young women (neos) to love their husbands...”</strong></em> Paul identifies this group not just by age, but by their need for "spiritual hygiene." Because they are "new" to the roles of wife and mother in a difficult culture like Crete, they require a "reproducible" model of holiness from the older women.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Matthew 9:17:</strong> <em><strong>“Nor do they put new (neos) wine into old wineskins...”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Corinthians 5:7:</strong> <em><strong>“Therefore purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new (neos) lump...”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Colossians 3:10:</strong> <em><strong>“and have put on the new (neos) man who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him,”</strong></em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> In the "Mastering the Bible" framework, the <em>neos</em> women represent the "future health" of the church. If they are not "admonished" toward "sound" living, the "sound doctrine" of the previous generation will not be passed on. Their training is the "bridge" that ensures the "Highway of Holiness" remains open for the next generation.</p>
