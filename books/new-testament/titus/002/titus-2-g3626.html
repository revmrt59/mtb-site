<p><strong>HOMEMAKERS</strong> — (<em>oikouros</em>, Strong—s G3626) Refers to one who stays at home and cares for household affairs. It describes a "sound" focus where the home is viewed not as a place of confinement, but as a primary sphere of ministry and a "spiritual container" where the Gospel is modeled and passed on.</p>
<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> A compound word derived from <em>oikos</em> (a house or dwelling) and <em>ouros</em> (a guard or watcher; one who keeps). It literally means "house-guardian" or "home-watcher."</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> Staying at home; domestic; looking after household affairs. It carries the idea of being "busy at home," taking responsibility for the order and atmosphere of the domestic life.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Guardian of the Hearth:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>oikouros</em> was used for a person who stayed behind to "guard" the home while others were away. It implied a vigilant protection of the family's resources and safety.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Master of the Domain:</strong> It pictured someone who ensured the house functioned smoothly—making it a place of "sound" order rather than chaos.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a lighthouse keeper; their primary duty is to stay at the station to ensure the light never goes out, providing safety and direction for everyone in the "household."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> The home is the first "mission field" of the believer. To be a "homemaker" in the biblical sense is to recognize that the domestic sphere is a "sacred fitness" (<em>hieroprepôs</em>) assignment. It is where "sound doctrine" is lived out in the most practical ways. It reveals that being "wholly His" includes the stewardship of one's immediate environment and the cultivation of a "reproducible" life of holiness within the family.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:5</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“to be discreet, chaste, homemakers (oikouros), good, obedient...”</strong></em>. Paul lists this among the traits the older women are to teach the young women. In a culture like Crete, where households could be "overturned" by false teaching (Titus 1:11), being a "house-guardian" was essential for protecting the family from spiritual and moral decay.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This specific word (<em>oikouros</em>) appears <strong>only here</strong> in the New Testament. Its singular use emphasizes the specific, focused role of the young woman in establishing a "sound" foundation for the church's future through the home.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This term does not imply a lack of productivity, but a <strong>priority of presence</strong>. It is the "action" of ensuring the home reflects the "goodness of God." In the "Mastering the Bible" framework, the <em>oikouros</em> is the one who keeps the "East Gate" of the family, ensuring that only what is "proper" and "becoming" to the Gospel enters the domestic life.</p>
