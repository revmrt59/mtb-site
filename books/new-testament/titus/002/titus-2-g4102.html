<li><p><strong>Greek Roots / Derivation:</strong> Derived from the verb <em>peithō</em> (to persuade or be persuaded). It is the result of God’s revelation persuading the human heart of the truth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meaning / Lexical Definition:</strong> A firm persuasion, belief, or trust in the truth of something. It is the divinely produced conviction that God is true and His promises are certain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Legal Guarantee:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>pistis</em> was used for a legal document that served as a guarantee or a "proof" of ownership.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Reliable Friend:</strong> It described the quality of a person who was completely "trustworthy" or "faithful" in their relationships.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a bridge that is solid and reliable; <em>pistis</em> is the confidence that the bridge will hold your weight.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Theological Implications:</strong> Faith is not a "work" we perform; it is a response to the revelation of God’s goodness. To be <strong>"sound in faith"</strong> means our trust is healthy and anchored in the person of Jesus rather than our own effort.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:2:</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“that the older men be... sound (hugiainō) in faith (pistis)”</strong></em>. Paul is teaching that as a man ages, his trust in God should become more robust and free from the "sickness" of doubt.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Hebrews 11:1:</strong> <em><strong>“Now faith (pistis) is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Romans 10:17:</strong> <em><strong>“So then faith (pistis) comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ephesians 2:8:</strong> <em><strong>“For by grace you have been saved through faith (pistis), and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,”</strong></em></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Relevant Insights:</strong> In the "Highway of Holiness," faith is the "embracing" phase where we receive what God provides. It is choosing to be "wholly His" through surrendered trust.</p></li>
