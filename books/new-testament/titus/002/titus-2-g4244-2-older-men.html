<li><p><strong>The Ambassador’s Dignity:</strong> Sometimes used for an "ambassador"—someone whose experience gave them the right to speak on behalf of a king.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a sturdy, old oak tree with deep roots; its presence provides shade and stability for everything around it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Theological Implications:</strong> Age in the body of Christ is intended to be a "container" for the character of God. It is not just about growing older; it is about the years producing a life that is <strong>"proper"</strong> for the Gospel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:2:</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“that the older men (presbytēs) be sober...”</strong></em>. Paul establishes that "sound doctrine" must first show up in the lives of those with the longest history with the Lord.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Luke 1:18:</strong> <em><strong>"And Zacharias said to the angel, 'How shall I know this? For I am an old man (presbytēs)...'"</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Philemon 1:9:</strong> <em><strong>"...being such a one as Paul the aged (presbytēs), and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ—"</strong></em></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Relevant Insights:</strong> In the ancient world, age was synonymous with honor. For Paul, the honor of the <strong>"older man"</strong> is found in his willingness to be sober, reverent, and temperate.</p></li>
