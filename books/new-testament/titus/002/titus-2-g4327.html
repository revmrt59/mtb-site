<p><strong>LOOKING</strong> — (<em>prosdechomai</em>, Strong’s G4327) Refers to a state of expectant waiting or "welcoming." It describes the posture of a "sound" believer who is actively watching for and ready to receive the "infinitely good" arrival of Christ, making the hope of His return the "governing" focus of their life.</p>
<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> A compound word formed from <em>pros</em> (toward) and <em>dechomai</em> (to receive or welcome). It carries the sense of "receiving toward oneself" with a high degree of anticipation.</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> To expect, to look for, or to wait for. In the New Testament, it is often used for the "sacred fitness" of those waiting for the fulfillment of God’s promises. It is not a passive waiting, but an "active" reaching out of the heart toward a future event.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Welcoming Host:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>prosdechomai</em> was used for a host standing at the "East Gate" of their home, looking down the road to "welcome" a long-awaited and "honored" guest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Alert Sentry:</strong> It pictured a watchman who is "wholly" focused on the horizon, waiting for the first "shining" of the morning sun.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a child at a window waiting for a parent to return home; the "looking" is so intense that it governs their current behavior. They are "properly" prepared because they know the arrival is "safe" and certain.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Expectancy is the "internal hygiene" of the believer’s hope. Since the grace of God has already "appeared" (<em>epiphainō</em>), the "sound" mind now looks for the next "appearing" in glory. To be <strong>"looking"</strong> is the "functional" evidence that the believer is no longer "intoxicated" by the "present age." It proves the heart is "wholly His" by placing its ultimate "meaning integrity" in the return of the King.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:13</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“looking (prosdechomai) for the blessed hope and glorious appearing...”</strong></em>. Paul connects the "proper" life (v. 12) with the "proper" focus (v. 13). We live soberly and righteously <em>because</em> we are "looking" for Him. This "active waiting" is the "spiritual revelation" that protects the believer from becoming "diseased" by worldly distractions.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mark 15:43:</strong> <em>“Joseph of Arimathea... who was himself also waiting (prosdechomai) for the kingdom of God...”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Luke 2:25:</strong> <em>“...and this man was just and devout, waiting (prosdechomai) for the Consolation of Israel...”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jude 1:21:</strong> <em>“keep yourselves in the love of God, looking (prosdechomai) for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.”</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "transparency" of our faith. If we are not <em>prosdechomai</em>, our "spiritual container" is likely filled with the "unhealthy" cares of this life. "Looking" is the "action" that ensures the "Highway of Holiness" is walked with an "upward" gaze. It makes the believer’s life a "reproducible" pattern of hope that "adorns the doctrine" by showing that this world is not our final home.</p>
