<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> A compound word formed from <em>anti</em> (against/opposite) and <em>legì</em> (to speak). It literally means "to speak against."</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> To contradict, gainsay, or oppose. In the context of a servant, it refers to the "unhealthy" habit of talking back, questioning orders with a defiant spirit, or engaging in "verbal rebellion" against a master.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Obstinate Witness:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>antilegì</em> was used for a witness who constantly contradicted the evidence or the judge, creating "chaos" in the courtroom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Raging Stream:</strong> It pictured water hitting a rock and "pushing back" or swirling in opposition to the flow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a "broken" seal; instead of a clean impression (<em>typos</em>), there is a jagged edge that refuses to take the shape of the master's will. <strong>"Not answering back"</strong> is the "internal hygiene" of a quiet and "safe" spirit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Submission to authority is a "spiritual revelation" of our submission to God. Since God is the source of all "proper" order, to "speak against" those He has placed over us is to manifest a "diseased" heart. A life that is "wholly His" is characterized by a "sacred fitness" that trusts God—s sovereignty, even when the human master is difficult.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:9</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“...to be well-pleasing in all things, not answering back (antilegì),”</strong></em> Paul targets this specific behavior because "talking back" was a primary way for a bondservant to show "hidden" rebellion. By refusing to engage in <em>antilegì</em>, the servant preserves the "meaning integrity" of their profession and keeps the "Highway of Holiness" free from the "stumbling block" of a defiant tongue.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Luke 2:34:</strong> <em><strong>“...and for a sign which will be spoken against (antilegì),”</strong></em> (Referring to Christ as the sign that the world would contradict).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>John 19:12:</strong> <em><strong>“...Whoever makes himself a king speaks against (antilegì) Caesar.”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Titus 1:9:</strong> <em><strong>“...that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convict those who contradict (antilegì).”</strong></em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "shielding" of the Gospel. If a believer is known for "answering back," their words become "unhealthy" and their "spiritual container" is viewed as "contaminated." "Not answering back" ensures that the servant "adorns the doctrine" (Titus 2:10) by showing that Christ provides a "sound" mind that doesn't need to "win" every verbal battle.</p>
