<p><strong>OBEDIENT</strong> — (<em>hypotassō</em>, Strong’s G5293) Refers to a voluntary spirit of cooperation and the choosing to place oneself under the authority or leadership of another. It describes a "sound" and orderly arrangement where the believer yields their own "will" to align with God’s established order for the sake of the Gospel.</p>
<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> A compound word formed from <em>hypo</em> (under) and <em>tassō</em> (to arrange or set in order). It is a military term that means "to arrange in order under a commander."</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> To subject oneself; to be submissive; to obey. It is important to note that in the New Testament, this word often appears in the middle voice, which emphasizes a <strong>voluntary</strong> act of yielding rather than a forced or servile compliance.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Disciplined Legion:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>hypotassō</em> was used to describe how soldiers were "set in order" within a phalanx. Every soldier had a specific place to stand so the entire unit could function with "sound" strength.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Musical Score:</strong> It was used for the way individual notes are "arranged under" a specific key or time signature to create harmony rather than noise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a master weaver following a pattern; the individual threads are "subjected" to the design so that the final tapestry reflects the beauty the weaver intended.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Submission is not a statement of "value," but a statement of "order." Since God is a God of order and not of confusion, being <em>hypotassō</em> is a way of honoring His design for human relationships. It is the ultimate refusal of the "leprous king of self" and a demonstration of being "wholly His." By yielding, the believer proves that their "safe mind" trusts God’s sovereignty more than their own autonomy.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:5</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“to be discreet, chaste, homemakers, good, obedient (hypotassō) to their own husbands...”</strong></em>. Paul emphasizes that the young woman’s submission is to her <strong>own</strong> husband, creating a "sacred fitness" within the marriage. This voluntary yielding is the "proper" response that protects the home from the "unhealthy" chaos of the surrounding culture.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Luke 2:51:</strong> <em><strong>“Then He [Jesus] went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject (hypotassō) to them...”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>James 4:7:</strong> <em><strong>“Therefore submit (hypotassō) to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Peter 5:5:</strong> <em><strong>“Likewise you younger people, submit (hypotassō) yourselves to your elders. Yes, all of you be submissive to one another...”</strong></em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> In the "Mastering the Bible" framework, this word represents the "functional" application of humility. It is the "action" that ensures the "Highway of Holiness" is not blocked by pride. For the young woman, being <em>hypotassō</em> is a powerful "reproducible" testimony that her life is governed by a "sound" trust in God’s plan for her family.</p>
