<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> A compound word formed from <em>philos</em> (friend, dear, or warm affection) and <em>teknon</em> (a child; that which is born).</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> Loving one's children; characterized by maternal affection. Like <em>philandros</em>, it emphasizes the "heart-connection" and natural fondness that should exist between a mother and her offspring.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Nurturing Parent:</strong> In secular Greek literature, <em>philoteknos</em> was the ideal of a mother who was "wrapped up" in the well-being of her children, prioritizing their growth and protection above her own comfort.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Hen and her Chicks:</strong> It carries the "picture" of a mother bird shielding and nourishing her young—a love that is both protective and tender.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a gardener who doesn't just plant a seed but delights in the daily watering and tending of the sprout; the <em>philoteknos</em> mother finds joy in the personhood and development of her children.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Children are a "spiritual trust" from God. To love them with <em>philos</em> affection is to reflect the "nourishing" heart of the Father. This word reveals that a "sound" home is one where children are not seen as a burden or a distraction, but as the primary "disciples" who are to be nurtured in the "sacred beauty" of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:4</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“that they admonish the young women to love their husbands, to love their children (philoteknos)...”</strong></em>. In the harsh environment of Crete, where life was often devalued, Paul emphasizes that "sound doctrine" must restore the natural, healthy affection of a mother. This love is a learned "discipline" that ensures the next generation is raised in an atmosphere of grace.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This specific word (<em>philoteknos</em>) appears <strong>only here</strong> in the New Testament. It is paired with <em>philandros</em> to show that the young woman’s "soundness" is primarily demonstrated through her devotion to her immediate family.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This term focuses on <strong>delight</strong>. It is more than just providing food and clothing; it is about "ascribing heaven's value" to the children. In the "Mastering the Bible" framework, this love is the "action" of a life that is "wholly His," ensuring that the "Highway of Holiness" begins in the nursery and the playroom.</p>
