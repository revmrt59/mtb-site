<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><strong>LOVE THEIR HUSBANDS</strong> — (<em>philandros</em>, Strong’s G5362) Refers to a woman who is affectionate and devoted to her husband. It describes a "sound" and healthy affection that prioritizes the marriage relationship as a primary area where the Gospel is made visible.</p>
<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> A compound word formed from <em>philos</em> (friend, dear, or warm affection) and <em>anēr</em> (man or husband).</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> Loving one’s husband; affectionate toward a husband. It carries the nuance of a warm, companionable love—the kind of love found in a deep friendship—applied specifically to the marriage bond.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> * <strong>The Harmonious Home:</strong> In secular Greek and ancient epitaphs, <em>philandros</em> was a term of high honor used to describe a wife whose devotion made the home a place of peace rather than strife.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Inseparable Companion:</strong> It pictured a wife who was not just a domestic manager, but her husband's closest "friend" and ally.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of two oxen yoked together who move in perfect synchronization; the <em>philandros</em> love ensures the "yoke" of marriage is not a burden but a partnership that moves forward with ease.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Marriage is a "spiritual revelation" of the relationship between Christ and the Church. To "love a husband" with <em>philos</em> affection is to demonstrate that the Gospel produces "sound" and healthy human relationships. It is a refusal to let the "sickness" of bitterness or indifference into the home, choosing instead to be "wholly His" by honoring the one God has joined you to.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:4</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“that they admonish the young women to love their husbands (philandros)...”</strong></em>. Paul includes this in the "training" for young women because, in the difficult culture of Crete, this kind of affectionate devotion was not always the "natural" response. It had to be taught and modeled as a "proper" fruit of sound doctrine.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> * This specific word (<em>philandros</em>) appears <strong>only here</strong> in the New Testament. Its companion word, <em>philoteknos</em> (loving children), immediately follows it, creating a "sound" foundation for the family.</p>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This term focuses on <strong>affection</strong> (<em>philos</em>) rather than just the volitional <em>agape</em> love mentioned earlier. It suggests that God cares about the "heart-connection" and the emotional health of a marriage. For the young woman, being <em>philandros</em> is a way to "adorn the doctrine of God" by making the Christian home an attractive witness to the world.</p>

<p>how does LOVE THEIR HUSBANDS contrast with the greek word where Paul commands in Ephesians for husbands to love their wives</p>
<p>That is a sharp observation. The contrast between these two passages reveals a beautiful, "sound" symmetry in how the Gospel functions within a marriage.</p>
<p>In <strong>Ephesians 5:25</strong>, Paul uses the verb <em><strong>agapaō</strong></em> (the verb form of <em>agape</em>), whereas in <strong>Titus 2:4</strong>, he uses the compound word <em><strong>philandros</strong></em> (rooted in <em>philos</em>).</p>
<p>Here is how they contrast:</p>
<p><strong>1. Source of the Love: Sacrifice vs. Affection</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Husbands (<em>agapaō</em>):</strong> The command for husbands is rooted in <strong>sacrificial, volitional love</strong>. It is modeled after Christ’s love for the Church—a love that "gives itself up." It is a love of the <strong>will</strong> that acts for the highest good of the wife, regardless of how the husband "feels" in the moment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wives (<em>philandros</em>):</strong> The training for young wives is rooted in <strong>warm, companionable affection</strong>. While she is certainly called to <em>agape</em> her husband as a fellow believer, <em>philandros</em> emphasizes the <strong>friendship</strong> and the "heart-connection." It is a love of <strong>fondness</strong> that makes the home a place of warmth.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. The Weight of the Command: Headship vs. Harmony</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>In Ephesians (Husbands):</strong> The husband is commanded to <em>agapaō</em> because he is the head. His love must be the "foundation" that provides security. It is a heavy, "priestly" responsibility to lay down his life.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>In Titus (Wives):</strong> The young woman is "admonished" (trained) to be <em>philandros</em> because she is the "heart" of the home. Her affection provides the "atmosphere." Paul is emphasizing that a "sound" marriage isn't just a legal arrangement; it's a deep, healthy friendship.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. "Proper" Fitness for the Gospel</strong></p>
<p>In your <strong>MTB framework</strong>, this contrast is a perfect example of what is <strong>"proper"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is "proper" for the one representing Christ’s headship to lead with <strong>sacrifice</strong> (<em>agape</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>It is "proper" for the one representing the Church’s response to be characterized by <strong>devoted affection</strong> (<em>philos</em>).</p></li>
</ul>
