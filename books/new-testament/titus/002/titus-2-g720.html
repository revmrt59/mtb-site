<p><strong>DENYING</strong> — (<em>arneomai</em>, Strong—s G720) Refers to a conscious act of repudiation, a refusal to recognize or associate with something. It describes the "decisive" move of a believer to say "no" to the old, "unhealthy" nature in order to say "yes" to the "sound" life of grace.</p>
<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> A primary verb. While it can mean "to deny" a fact, in this moral context, it means "to renounce" or "to disown."</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> To say "no," to refuse, or to reject. It denotes a total break from a previous allegiance. It is the "action" of turning one's back on something that was once embraced.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Legal Renunciation:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>arneomai</em> was used for a citizen who formally renounced their citizenship or a person who disowned a family member, legally "breaking" the relationship.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Refused Invitation:</strong> It pictured someone being offered a gift or an invitation and firmly pushing it away because it was "improper" for them to accept.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a gardener "denying" the weeds a place in the soil; he doesn't just ignore them, he actively pulls them out so the "good" fruit can grow. <strong>"Denying"</strong> is the "internal hygiene" of the soul that refuses to host "unhealthy" desires.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Grace-based living requires a "theological boundary." To be "wholly His," one must disown the "leprous king of self." <strong>"Denying"</strong> is the functional side of repentance—it is the "proper" response to the light of the Gospel. It proves that the "safe mind" of the believer has evaluated "ungodliness" and found it to be "diseased" and "unfit" for the "Highway of Holiness."</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:12</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“...teaching us that, denying (arneomai) ungodliness and worldly lusts...”</strong></em>. Paul shows that the first lesson in the "school of grace" is learning how to say "no." Before we can "adorn" the doctrine with "good" works, we must first "strip off" the "unhealthy" habits of the world.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Matthew 16:24:</strong> <em><strong>“Then Jesus said to His disciples, ΓÇÿIf anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny (arneomai) himself...—”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 2:12:</strong> <em><strong>“...If we deny (arneomai) Him, He also will deny (arneomai) us.”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Titus 1:16:</strong> <em><strong>“They profess to know God, but in works they deny (arneomai) Him...”</strong></em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "shielding" aspect of a holy life. To deny ungodliness is to close the "gate" of the heart to anything that would "contaminate" the "spiritual container." It is the "meaning integrity" of the faith—ensuring that our "actions" match our "profession" by rejecting what God rejects.</p>
