<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><strong>UNGODLINESS</strong> — (<em>asebeia</em>, Strong—s G763) Refers to a lack of reverence or a disregard for God. It describes a "diseased" state of heart that lives as if God does not exist or does not matter, resulting in a life that is "unhealthy" and "improper" in its focus.</p>
<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> Derived from <em>a</em> (not) and <em>sebomai</em> (to worship or revere). It is the direct opposite of <em>eusebeia</em> (godliness).</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> Want of reverence toward God; impiety; wickedness. It is not just the absence of religion, but an active "pushing away" of God—s authority and presence from one—s thoughts and actions.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Desecrated Temple:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>asebeia</em> was used for someone who entered a sacred space with "unclean" feet or who treated holy things as "common."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Lawless Citizen:</strong> It pictured a person who lived within a kingdom but refused to acknowledge the king—s laws, acting as though they were their own "leprous" sovereign.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a compass that has lost its magnetic "soundness"; it no longer points to the North (God), causing the traveler to wander into "unhealthy" and dangerous territory. <strong>"Ungodliness"</strong> is the state of having no "sacred fitness."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Ungodliness is the root of all "unhealthy" living. When the "meaning integrity" of God—s supremacy is lost, the life inevitably becomes "corrupt." It is the refusal to be "wholly His." To "deny ungodliness" is to re-establish the "proper" order of the soul, where God is once again the "infinitely good" center of all things.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:12</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“...teaching us that, denying ungodliness (asebeia) and worldly lusts...”</strong></em>. Paul lists this first because our "internal hygiene" must begin with our relationship with God. Before we can fix our "worldly lusts" (how we relate to things), we must fix our <em>asebeia</em> (how we relate to Him).</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Romans 1:18:</strong> <em><strong>“For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness (asebeia) and unrighteousness of men...”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 2:16:</strong> <em><strong>“But shun profane and idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness (asebeia).”</strong></em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jude 1:15:</strong> <em><strong>“to execute judgment on all, to convict all who are ungodly (asebôs) among them of all their ungodly (asebeia) deeds...”</strong></em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "spiritual revelation" of a heart in rebellion. It is the "action" of living in the dark while the light of grace has already "appeared" (<em>epiphainì</em>). By denying <em>asebeia</em>, the believer ensures their "spiritual container" is no longer "contaminated" by the pride of the "leprous king of self," allowing for a "sound" and "reproducible" walk on the "Highway of Holiness."</p>
