<p><strong>INTEGRITY</strong> — (<em>aphthoria</em>, Strong—s G861) Refers to a state of being uncorrupted, pure, and sincere. It describes a "soundness" in teaching that is free from any mixture of selfish motive, false doctrine, or hidden compromise, ensuring the message remains "wholly His."</p>
<h2 id="full-study">Full Study:</h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong> Derived from <em>a</em> (not) and <em>phtheirì</em> (to corrupt, spoil, or destroy). It carries the primary idea of being "incorruptible."</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong> Incorruptibility, purity, or sincerity. In the context of teaching, it refers to the quality of a message that has not been "watered down" or polluted by worldly influences. It is the "internal hygiene" of doctrine.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Pure Metal:</strong> In secular Greek, it was used to describe gold or silver that had no dross or "admixtures" of cheaper metals. It was 100% what it claimed to be.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Unspoiled Fruit:</strong> It pictured food that was fresh and free from decay; it had no "sickness" or rot within it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a pristine mountain spring; it is characterized by <em>aphthoria</em> because there is nothing in the water that shouldn't be there. It is clear, life-giving, and "sound."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong> Integrity is the "meaning integrity" of the Gospel. Since God is "infinitely good," His Word must be handled with a "sacred fitness" that refuses to twist or manipulate the truth for personal gain. To teach with <strong>integrity</strong> is to ensure that the "spiritual container" of the message is as clean as the truth itself.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 2:7</strong> The NKJV says: <em><strong>“...in doctrine showing integrity (aphthoria), reverence, incorruptibility,”</strong></em>. Paul commands Titus to ensure his teaching is "uncorrupted." This is the "functional" side of sound doctrine—if the teacher lacks integrity, the "soundness" of the message is compromised and the "Highway of Holiness" becomes obscured.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This specific word (<em>aphthoria</em>) appears <strong>only here</strong> in the New Testament. However, its root <em>phtheirì</em> and related words for "incorruptibility" (<em>aphtharsia</em>) are used frequently to describe the eternal nature of God and the resurrected body (e.g., <strong>1 Corinthians 15:52</strong>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong> This word represents the "transparency" required of a leader. It is the refusal to let the "leprous king of self" influence the delivery of the Word. Integrity ensures that when people look at the "pattern" of the teacher's doctrine, they see only the "sacred beauty" of Christ without any hidden "rot."</p>
