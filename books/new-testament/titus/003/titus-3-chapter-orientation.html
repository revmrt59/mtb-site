<h2 id="chapter-summary">Chapter Summary</h2>
<p>Titus 3 turns outward to how believers live in the world and within the church. Paul reminds believers to be submissive to governing authorities, gentle toward others, and ready for good works. He grounds this call in the reality of salvation. Believers were once sinful and lost, but God saved them through His mercy, not through righteous deeds. This salvation brings new life through the Holy Spirit. Because of this, believers are to focus on good works and avoid foolish disputes and divisive behavior that harm the church—s witness.</p>
