          <h3 id="a.-historical-cultural-and-pastoral-context">A.
          Historical, Cultural, and Pastoral Context</h3>
          <p>The letter to Titus is written by the apostle Paul to a
          trusted co-laborer whom Paul left in Crete to complete
          unfinished work among newly established churches.</p>
          <p>Paul states the purpose of the letter clearly.</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:5</strong> <em>For this reason I left you
          in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are
          lacking, and appoint elders in every city as I commanded
          you.</em> (NKJV)</p>
          <p>From the outset, Titus is concerned with order, leadership,
          church health and doctrine that promotes godliness and right
          living instead of engendering arguments or strife. The
          churches were immature and unhealthy. What was lacking was not
          enthusiasm or profession, but structure, leadership, maturity,
          and health.</p>
          <h4 id="tituss-role-and-authority">1. Titus’s role and
          authority</h4>
          <p>Titus is not addressed as a local pastor acting
          independently, but as Paul’s apostolic delegate, exercising
          authority derived from Paul’s commission.</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:4</strong> <em>To Titus, a true son in our
          common faith:</em> (NKJV)</p>
          <p>The New Testament shows that Titus was a frequent and very
          close traveling companion with Paul. Titus appears in a
          variety of contexts and difficult situations. These required
          discretion, firmness, courage, and theological clarity
          (Galatians 2:1–3; 2 Corinthians 7:6–7). This indicates that
          Titus was seasoned, trusted, and capable of handling difficult
          pastoral situations. The instructions given in this letter
          therefore carry apostolic weight, not merely personal
          counsel.</p>
          <h4 id="cultural-context-crete">2. Cultural context:
          Crete</h4>
          <p>It is likely that the churches in Crete began shortly after
          Pentecost, as Cretans were present in Jerusalem and may have
          carried the gospel back with them (Acts 2:11). The churches
          addressed in Titus were formed both within a culture that did
          not encourage moral discipline or truthfulness and in the
          absence of godly leadership. Paul describes the prevailing
          environment with unusual directness.</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:12–13</strong> <em>“Cretans are always
          liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” This testimony is
          true.</em> (NKJV)</p>
          <p>Paul’s concern is not cultural commentary for its own sake,
          but pastoral realism. Instead of the church impacting culture,
          the culture impacted the church. This explains why Titus
          repeatedly emphasizes self-control, integrity, and conduct
          that visibly accords with the gospel (Titus 2:1–10;
          3:1–2).</p>
          <h4 id="the-internal-problem-facing-the-churches">3. The
          internal problem facing the churches</h4>
          <p>Paul’s primary concern is the internal disorder and
          unhealthy influence within the churches.</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:10–11</strong> <em>For there are many
          insubordinate, both idle talkers and deceivers… whose mouths
          must be stopped…</em> (NKJV)</p>
          <p>False teaching, distorted motives, and lack of restraint
          were undermining households and weakening the church’s
          witness.</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:16</strong> <em>They profess to know God,
          but in works they deny Him…</em> (NKJV)</p>
          <p>This contrast between profession and practice frames much
          of the letter.</p>
          <h4 id="sound-healthy-doctrine-as-the-governing-emphasis">4.
          Sound (healthy) doctrine as the governing emphasis</h4>
          <p>Paul frames his ministry around truth that produces
          godliness. The purpose of truth is to promote godly living.
          Truth is not something only to believe, but rather something
          to be lived.</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:1</strong> <em>…the acknowledgment of the
          truth which accords with godliness.</em> (NKJV)</p>
          <p>Throughout the letter, Paul repeatedly stresses sound
          (healthy) doctrine.</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p><strong>Titus 1:9</strong> <em>holding fast the
          faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able, by
          sound doctrine, both to exhort and convict those who
          contradict.</em> (NKJV)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Titus 1:13</strong> <em>This testimony is true.
          Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the
          faith,</em> (NKJV)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Titus 2:1</strong> <em>But as for you, speak
          the things which are proper for sound doctrine:</em>
          (NKJV)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Titus 2:2</strong> <em>that the older men be
          sober, reverent, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in
          patience;</em> (NKJV)</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Healthy teaching results in healthy lives.</p>
          <h4 id="leadership-as-the-means-of-preservation">5. Leadership
          as the means of preservation</h4>
          <p>Paul begins with elders because leadership shapes the life
          and direction of the church.</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:7–9</strong> <em>For a bishop must be
          blameless… holding fast the faithful word as he has been
          taught…</em> (NKJV)</p>
          <p>Leaders are responsible first to live a godly life and
          secondly to ensure healthy teaching.</p>
          <h4 id="grace-and-godly-living">6. Grace and godly living</h4>
          <p>Grace is central in Titus, not merely as the basis of
          salvation, but as the enabling power for godly living.</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 2:11–12</strong> <em>For the grace of God
          that brings salvation has appeared to all men, teaching us
          that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live
          soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age.</em>
          (NKJV)</p>
          <p>In Titus, grace does not compel obedience through pressure,
          nor does it merely forgive failure. Grace supplies what is
          necessary to live differently. What God commands, His grace
          provides. Godly living flows from grace received, not from
          self-effort imposed.</p>
          <p><strong>7. Good works as the visible fruit of
          faith</strong></p>
          <p>One of the clearest emphases in Titus is the repeated call
          to good works as the expected outcome of sound doctrine and
          genuine faith.</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p><strong>Titus 1:16</strong> <em>They profess to know
          God, but in works they deny Him, being abominable,
          disobedient, and disqualified for every good work.</em>
          (NKJV)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Titus 2:7</strong> <em>in all things showing
          yourself to be a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing
          integrity, reverence, incorruptibility,</em> (NKJV)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Titus 2:14</strong> <em>who gave Himself for
          us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify
          for Himself His own special people, zealous for good
          works.</em> (NKJV)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Titus 3:8</strong> <em>This is a faithful
          saying, and these things I want you to affirm constantly, that
          those who have believed in God should be careful to maintain
          good works. These things are good and profitable to men.</em>
          (NKJV)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Titus 3:14</strong> <em>And let our people also
          learn to maintain good works, to meet urgent needs, that they
          may not be unfruitful.</em> (NKJV)</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Good works are not the root of salvation, but they are its
          expected fruit and public evidence.</p>
          <h4 id="context-summary">8. Context summary</h4>
          <p>Paul writes to Titus to establish order in the churches
          through sound doctrine, qualified leadership, and lives marked
          by good works. In a difficult cultural setting, the
          credibility of the gospel depends on a church that is
          spiritually healthy, doctrinally sound, and visibly
          transformed by the grace of God.</p>
          <h3 id="big-idea-of-titus">BIG IDEA OF TITUS</h3>
          <p>God’s grace establishes spiritually healthy churches
          through Biblical church government, sound doctrine, qualified
          leadership, and lives marked by good works.</p>
          <h3 id="core-themes-of-titus">CORE THEMES OF TITUS</h3>
          <h3 id="sound-doctrine-that-produces-godliness">1. Sound
          doctrine that produces godliness</h3>
          <p>In Titus, doctrine is never treated as abstract belief or
          intellectual agreement. Truth is given to be lived out, not
          merely affirmed. Paul repeatedly emphasizes sound, or healthy,
          doctrine because unhealthy teaching produces unhealthy lives.
          Sound doctrine promotes godliness, stability, and spiritual
          maturity rather than speculation, division, or strife.<br />
          (Titus 1:1; 1:9; 2:1–2)</p>
          <h3 id="church-leadership-as-essential-to-church-health">2.
          Church leadership as essential to church health</h3>
          <p>Paul places immediate emphasis on appointing elders because
          Biblical church government is essential for the health of a
          local church. Qualified leaders protect the church from
          unhealthy teaching, model godly living, and provide stability
          in difficult cultural settings. Where there is a lack of
          Biblical church government or unqualified leadership, disorder
          and spiritual unhealthiness will follow.<br />
          (Titus 1:5–9)</p>
          <h3 id="grace-as-the-source-of-godly-living">3. Grace as the
          source of godly living</h3>
          <p>Grace in Titus is not presented merely as forgiveness, but
          as God’s provision for a changed life. What God commands, His
          grace supplies. Godly living flows from grace received, not
          from self-effort imposed. Grace enables believers to live
          soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age.<br />
          (Titus 2:11–14)</p>
          <h3 id="good-works-as-the-visible-fruit-of-faith">4. Good
          works as the visible fruit of faith</h3>
          <p>Good works appear repeatedly throughout Titus as the
          expected fruit of genuine faith and sound doctrine. They do
          not earn salvation, but they provide visible evidence of
          genuine faith and spiritual health.<br />
          (Titus 1:16; 2:7, 14; 3:8, 14)</p>
          <h3 id="the-credibility-of-the-gospel-in-a-hostile-culture">5.
          The credibility of the gospel in a hostile culture</h3>
          <p>Titus is written in a setting where the surrounding culture
          did not reinforce truth or godliness. Paul’s concern is that
          the gospel not be dishonored. Lives marked by self-control,
          integrity, humility, and good works serve to commend the
          gospel and protect its public witness.<br />
          (Titus 2:5, 8, 10; 3:1–2)</p>
          <h3 id="order-as-a-servant-of-spiritual-life">6. Order as a
          servant of spiritual life</h3>
          <p>Paul’s call to “set in order” what was lacking reflects a
          concern for structure that supports life, not control for its
          own sake. Biblical church government, healthy teaching, and
          godly leadership, creates an environment where spiritual
          growth and maturity can flourish and make for a healthy local
          church.<br />
          (Titus 1:5; 3:1)</p>

          <em>This map shows the island of Crete as it existed in the
          Roman period during the New Testament era. Crete was a large
          island with numerous cities which helps explain why Paul
          instructed Titus to appoint elders in every city, emphasizing
          the need for local, godly leadership in each local church.

          Christianity.</em></p>
