<h2 id="paul-establishes-titus-authority-in-crete-titus-114">1. Paul Establishes Titus’ Authority in Crete (Titus 1:1–4)</h2>
<div class="mtb-scripture-block">
<div>
<p>Titus 1:1-4 Paul, a bondservant (G1401) of God and an apostle (G6052) of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect and the acknowledgment of the truth which accords with godliness, 2 in hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began, 3 but has in due time manifested His word through preaching, which was committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior; 4 To Titus, a true son in our common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. (NKJV)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Paul opens the letter by explaining who he is and why he has the right to speak. He calls himself a <span data-custom-style="Strong">bondservant of God</span> and an <span data-custom-style="Strong">apostle of Jesus Christ</span>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>A <span data-custom-style="Strong">bondservant</span> is someone who belongs to another. Paul is saying his life and work belong to God. He does not speak for himself or act on personal preference.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>An <span data-custom-style="Strong">apostle</span> is someone sent with authority to represent another. Paul is saying he was sent by Jesus Christ to speak on His behalf. What he writes carries weight because it comes from a commission, not from opinion.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Paul then explains what his work is meant to accomplish. His ministry serves <span data-custom-style="Strong">the faith of God’s people</span> and <span data-custom-style="Strong">their understanding of the truth</span>. This truth is not just information. It is truth that leads to <span data-custom-style="Strong">godliness</span>, meaning a life that reflects obedience and reverence toward God. If belief does not show up in how people live, it has missed its purpose.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Paul connects this truth and godly living to <span data-custom-style="Strong">hope</span>, specifically the hope of <span data-custom-style="Strong">eternal life</span>. This hope is dependable because it rests on God, who <span data-custom-style="Strong">cannot lie</span>. What believers are trusting in is secure, not because people are faithful, but because of who God is.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He then says this eternal life was <span data-custom-style="Strong">promised before time began</span>. In other words, the gospel is not a reaction to human failure. It was part of God’s eternal purpose before history started.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Paul explains how that promise became known. God made His word clear <span data-custom-style="Strong">through preaching</span>, and Paul says this message was <span data-custom-style="Strong">entrusted to him</span>. He speaks because God commanded him to do so. He is responsible to deliver the message, not reshape it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Only after establishing all of this does Paul address Titus. He calls him a <span data-custom-style="Strong">true son in a shared faith</span>. Titus is not acting independently. He stands in the same faith and under the same truth Paul has described.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Paul closes with a blessing of <span data-custom-style="Strong">grace, mercy, and peace</span> from God the Father and Jesus Christ our Savior. That blessing matters because the work ahead will be demanding, and it will require God’s help, not just effort.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Together, these opening verses establish that:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>authority comes from God, not personality,</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">

<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>hope rests on God’s unchanging character,</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)">
<p>and leadership flows from shared faith and divine calling.</p>

<div class="mtb-scripture-block">
<div>
<p><span data-custom-style="Emphasis"><em>Titus 1:5</em></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span data-custom-style="Emphasis"><em>“For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking, and appoint elders in every city as I commanded you—”</em></span> <span data-custom-style="Strong">(NKJV)</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Paul now tells Titus why he is in Crete. Titus is not there by chance. Paul says, “For this reason I left you in Crete.” He stayed behind on purpose.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The churches in Crete already existed, but they were unfinished. That is what Paul means by <span data-custom-style="Strong">“the things that are lacking.”</span> Something had started, but it was not yet put together the way it needed to be.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>To <span data-custom-style="Strong">“set in order”</span> means to straighten what is incomplete or out of place. Paul is saying the gospel had taken root, but without structure it would not last. Truth needs support if it is going to shape people’s lives over time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Paul then says what that support looks like: <span data-custom-style="Strong">“appoint elders in every city.”</span> Elders are leaders who guard teaching, set an example, and care for the church. Paul does not treat this as optional. Where there is a church, there must be leadership.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The phrase <span data-custom-style="Strong">“in every city”</span> shows this was meant to be normal, not selective. Every local church needed faithful oversight.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Paul ends by saying, <span data-custom-style="Strong">“as I commanded you.”</span> Titus is not inventing this. He is carrying out what has already been given. His authority comes from obedience, not personality.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This verse moves the letter from foundation to action. What Paul described in verses 1–4 now has to take shape in real churches, with real leaders, in real places.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Of foundational importance, each church is to be locally governed by a plurality of qualified elders. Shared oversight provides accountability, balance, and protection for the body</p>

<h2 id="gods-design-for-church-leadership-qualified-elders-titus-169">3. God’s Design for Church Leadership: Qualified Elders (Titus 1:6–9)</h2>
<div class="mtb-scripture-block">
<div>
<p><strong>Titus 1:6-9</strong> if a man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of dissipation or insubordination. 7 For a bishop must be blameless, as a steward of God, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money, 8 but hospitable, a lover of what is good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled, 9 holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convict those who contradict. (NKJV)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>In these verses, Paul explains what kind of men Titus is to appoint as elders. He does not focus on skills, charisma, or public ability. He focuses on <span data-custom-style="Strong">character</span>, <span data-custom-style="Strong">home life</span>, and <span data-custom-style="Strong">faithfulness to the truth</span>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>An elder must be <span data-custom-style="Strong">blameless</span>. This does not mean sinless. It means there is no ongoing pattern of life that undermines trust or brings reproach. An elder’s life must not contradict the message he is responsible to guard.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Paul then points to the elder’s <span data-custom-style="Strong">family life</span>. He is to be the husband of one wife, meaning he is faithful and devoted in marriage. His children are to be believers, or at least not living in open rebellion or disorder. Paul’s concern is simple: if a man cannot lead well in his own household, he cannot be trusted to care for God’s people. The home shows whether leadership is real or only claimed.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Paul explains why this matters by describing the elder as <span data-custom-style="Strong">God’s steward</span>. A steward is someone entrusted with another person’s property. The church belongs to God, not to the elder. Leadership is a responsibility, not a possession.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Because of that, Paul names attitudes that must not mark an elder. He must not be self-willed, quick-tempered, given to drunkenness, violent, or driven by dishonest gain. These traits all point to lack of self-control and misuse of authority. A man who cannot govern himself cannot be trusted to care for others.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Paul then turns to what an elder <span data-custom-style="Strong">must be</span>. He must be hospitable, loving what is good, sober-minded, just, holy, and self-controlled. These qualities describe a life that is steady, disciplined, and shaped by reverence for God. An elder’s life should make the gospel visible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Finally, Paul addresses the elder’s relationship to teaching. He must <span data-custom-style="Strong">hold firmly to the trustworthy word as it has been taught</span>. This means he knows the apostolic message, remains loyal to it, and does not adjust it to suit culture or preference.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>That faithfulness has two purposes. First, the elder must be able to <span data-custom-style="Strong">encourage others with sound teaching</span>. Second, he must be able to <span data-custom-style="Strong">correct those who oppose it</span>. Leadership is not only care and guidance; it also includes protection. Truth must be defended so the church is not led astray.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>These verses make clear that church leadership is about trust, faithfulness, and guarding what God has given. Elders are not chosen for prominence, but for proven lives and steady commitment to the truth.</p>

<h2 id="the-danger-of-false-teachers-and-the-need-for-correction-titus-11016">4. The Danger of False Teachers and the Need for Correction (Titus 1:10–16)</h2>
<div class="mtb-scripture-block">
<div>
<p><span data-custom-style="Emphasis"><strong>Titus 1:16</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span data-custom-style="Emphasis"><strong>“For there are many insubordinate, both idle talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole households, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of dishonest gain. One of them, a prophet of their own, said, ‘Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.’ This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn from the truth. To the pure all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but even their mind and conscience are defiled. They profess to know God, but in works they deny Him, being abominable, disobedient, and disqualified for every good work.”</strong></span> <span data-custom-style="Strong">(NKJV)</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Paul now explains why leadership and order matter so much in Crete. The danger is not distant or theoretical. He says plainly that there are <span data-custom-style="Strong">many</span> who are rebellious, deceptive, and disruptive.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>These teachers talk freely but do not teach truth. Their words sound persuasive, but they mislead. Paul says they are <span data-custom-style="Strong">subverting whole households</span>, meaning their influence spreads quietly through families and small gatherings, undoing faith where it should be growing. The problem is made worse by motive. They teach “for the sake of dishonest gain.” This is not confusion; it is misuse of religion for advantage.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Paul singles out “those of the circumcision,” referring to teachers who insisted on Jewish identity markers and rules as necessary for faithfulness. They mixed parts of the law, stories, and human traditions with the gospel, pulling people away from what God had actually revealed.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>To make the point clear, Paul quotes one of Crete’s own voices. The description is blunt, but the purpose is clarity. This is the cultural environment the churches are living in. Deception, excess, and laziness were not unusual. They were normal. Paul says this matters because the church does not exist in a vacuum. Leaders must be realistic about the setting they are shepherding in.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Because the danger is real, Paul calls for <span data-custom-style="Strong">firm correction</span>. He tells Titus to rebuke sharply, not to harm, but to restore. The goal is not control or punishment. The goal is that people would become <span data-custom-style="Strong">sound in the faith</span>, meaning healthy and steady, not confused or unstable.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Paul then presses deeper. The problem is not food, objects, or outward practices. The real issue is the inner person. When people are defiled on the inside, everything becomes distorted. Rules cannot fix a corrupted conscience. What is broken internally shows up everywhere.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Paul ends the chapter by naming the core contradiction. These teachers <span data-custom-style="Strong">claim to know God</span>, but their lives deny Him. What they say and how they live do not match. That disconnect makes them unfit to lead or teach, no matter how confident or religious they appear.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This section explains why Paul insisted on qualified elders. Without faithful leadership, false teaching spreads, households are damaged, and the gospel is obscured. Correction is not optional, because truth matters, and lives are shaped by what people are taught to believe.</p>
</div>
