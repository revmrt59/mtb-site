          Establishes Titus’ Authority in Crete (Titus
          1:1–4</strong>)</h3>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:1</strong> Paul, a bondservant of God and
          an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s
          elect and the acknowledgment of the truth which accords with
          godliness,</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:2</strong> in hope of eternal life which
          God, who cannot lie, promised before time began,</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:3</strong> but has in due time manifested
          His word through preaching, which was committed to me
          according to the commandment of God our Savior;</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:4</strong> To Titus, a true son in
          <em>our</em> common faith: Grace, mercy, <em>and</em> peace
          from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</p>
          <h3 id="why-titus-was-left-in-crete-titus-15">Why Titus Was
          Left in Crete (Titus 1:5)</h3>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:5</strong> For this reason I left you in
          Crete, that you should set in order the things that are
          lacking, and appoint elders in every city as I commanded
          you—</p>
          <h3
          id="gods-design-for-church-leadership-qualified-elders-titus-169">God’s
          Design for Church Leadership: Qualified Elders (Titus
          1:6–9)</h3>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:6</strong> if a man is blameless, the
          husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of
          dissipation or insubordination.</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:7</strong> For a bishop must be blameless,
          as a steward of God, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not
          given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money,</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:8</strong> but hospitable, a lover of what
          is good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled,</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:9</strong> holding fast the faithful word
          as he has been taught, that he may be able, by sound doctrine,
          both to exhort and convict those who contradict.</p>
          <h3
          id="the-danger-of-false-teachers-and-the-need-for-correction-tit-11016">The
          danger of false teachers and the need for correction (Tit
          1:10–16)</h3>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:10</strong> For there are many
          insubordinate, both idle talkers and deceivers, especially
          those of the circumcision,</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:11</strong> whose mouths must be stopped,
          who subvert whole households, teaching things which they ought
          not, for the sake of dishonest gain.</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:12</strong> One of them, a prophet of their
          own, said, “Cretans <em>are</em> always liars, evil beasts,
          lazy gluttons.”</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:13</strong> This testimony is true.
          Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the
          faith,</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:14</strong> not giving heed to Jewish
          fables and commandments of men who turn from the truth.</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:15</strong> To the pure all things are
          pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is
          pure; but even their mind and conscience are defiled.</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:16</strong> They profess to know God, but
          in works they deny Him, being abominable, disobedient, and
          disqualified for every good work.</p>
