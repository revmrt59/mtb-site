          1: LEADERSHIP THAT SHAPES A HEALTHY CHURCH (NKJV)</h2>
          <p>Purpose of This Chapter<br />
          Titus 1 explains how God establishes order and health in His
          church. Paul shows that truth which produces godliness,
          qualified leadership appointed according to God’s design, and
          the courage to confront false teaching are essential for the
          protection and maturity of God’s people.</p>

          1:1–4</strong> Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of
          Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect and the
          acknowledgment of the truth which accords with godliness, in
          hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised
          before time began, but has in due time manifested His word
          through preaching, which was committed to me according to the
          commandment of God our Savior; To Titus, a true son in our
          common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and
          the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. (NKJV)</h6>
          <p>Paul begins the letter by establishing authority, not for
          personal status, but for stewardship. He identifies himself
          first as a servant belonging to God and then as one sent by
          Jesus Christ. Authority is grounded in calling and
          faithfulness, not personality or position.</p>
          <p>Paul defines truth by its outcome. Truth that comes from
          God produces godliness. Teaching that does not lead to a
          changed life has failed its purpose. Paul anchors this truth
          in the hope of eternal life, promised by God before time began
          and revealed through preaching at the proper time. The message
          is trustworthy because it rests on the character of God, who
          cannot lie.</p>
          <p>Titus is addressed as a true son in a common faith. This
          language emphasizes shared belief and shared life rather than
          hierarchy. Paul’s confidence in Titus is relational and
          spiritual, not merely administrative.</p>
          <p>See Appendix B: Who is Titus? Why could Paul entrust Titus?
          (Titus 1:1–4)</p>
          <p><strong>Why Titus was left in Crete and what was lacking
          (Titus 1:5)</strong></p>

          1:5</strong> For this reason I left you in Crete, that you
          should set in order the things that are lacking, and appoint
          elders in every city as I commanded you. (NKJV)</h6>
          <p>Paul states plainly why Titus was left in Crete. Churches
          existed, but they were incomplete and disordered. What was
          lacking was not enthusiasm or activity, but structure,
          qualified leadership, and protection from harmful
          influences.</p>
          <p>Paul addresses leadership first because leadership shapes
          doctrine, direction, culture, health, and protection. Setting
          things in order means bringing the life of the church into
          alignment with what God has already revealed. Disorder left
          unaddressed spreads and harms people, especially
          households.</p>

          1:5)</p>
          <p><strong>God’s design for church leadership: qualified
          elders (Titus 1:6–9)</strong></p>

          1:6–9</strong> If a man is blameless, the husband of one wife,
          having faithful children not accused of dissipation or
          insubordination. For a bishop must be blameless, as a steward
          of God, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to
          wine, not violent, not greedy for money, but hospitable, a
          lover of what is good, sober-minded, just, holy,
          self-controlled, holding fast the faithful word as he has been
          taught, that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both to exhort
          and convict those who contradict. (NKJV)</h6>
          <p>Paul outlines qualifications for elders that focus on
          character, household faithfulness, self-control, relational
          maturity, and doctrinal stability. Leadership in the church is
          stewardship. Elders manage what belongs to God and must
          therefore live in a way that is credible and trustworthy.</p>
          <p>These qualifications show that leadership is tested over
          time. The home is the proving ground for spiritual maturity.
          The ability to teach and correct flows from holding firmly to
          the faithful word. Authority is exercised through faithfulness
          to Scripture, not force of personality.</p>
          <p>Each church is to be locally governed by a plurality of
          qualified elders. Shared oversight provides accountability,
          balance, and protection for the body.</p>
          <p>The danger of false teachers and the need for correction
          (Titus 1:10–16)</p>
          <p><strong>Titus 1:10–16</strong> <em>For there are many
          insubordinate, both idle talkers and deceivers,
          especially</em> those of the circumcision, whose mouths must
          be stopped, who subvert whole households, teaching things
          which they ought not, for the sake of dishonest gain… They
          profess to know God, but in works they deny Him, being
          abominable, disobedient, and disqualified for every good work.
          (NKJV)</p>
          <p>Paul explains why qualified leadership is necessary. False
          teachers are not harmless. Their words undermine faith and
          destabilize households. In a difficult cultural environment,
          these voices must be confronted directly.</p>
          <p>Correction is commanded so that people may become sound in
          the faith. The goal is restoration and health, not
          humiliation. Paul concludes with a sober diagnosis. Some
          profess to know God, but their lives deny Him. Obedience, not
          verbal profession, is the evidence of genuine knowledge of
          God.</p>
          <p>This closing warning prepares the way for chapters 2 and 3,
          where sound doctrine is displayed through everyday life and
          good works.</p>
