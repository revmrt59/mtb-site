<p><strong>1. Greek roots / derivation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A common Koine Greek term for a slave or bondservant.</p></li>
<li><p>Emphasizes ownership and submission rather than temporary service.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / definition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A slave; one whose will is fully subject to another.</p></li>
<li><p>One who belongs to a master and exists to carry out the master’s purposes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek culture in Biblical times (with examples if relevant)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the Greco-Roman world, a <em>doulos</em> was legally owned and had no autonomous status.</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>doulos</em> represented the authority, interests, and reputation of the master.</p></li>
<li><p>Socially, the term carried low status; educated elites avoided applying it to themselves, making Paul’s usage intentionally countercultural.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological implications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Christian leadership is grounded in <strong>submission before authority</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Paul presents himself first as owned by God, redefining greatness as obedience.</p></li>
<li><p>This anticipates the epistle’s rejection of self-willed leaders (Titus 1:7).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Contextual nuance in the verse</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Bondservant of God” precedes “apostle of Jesus Christ,” establishing identity before office.</p></li>
<li><p>Authority to correct, rebuke, and order the church flows from submission to God, not personal force.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Key uses of the word in other verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Romans 1:1</strong> <em>Paul, a bondservant (doulos) of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God</em> (NKJV)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Philippians 1:1</strong> <em>Paul and Timothy, bondservants (douloi) of Jesus Christ, To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the bishops and deacons</em> (NKJV)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other relevant insights (summary or comment)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Doulos</em> sets the tone for the entire letter: truth that produces godliness must be stewarded by men who are mastered by God.</p></li>
<li><p>The word quietly rebukes religious ambition, greed, and domination — central problems addressed later in Titus 1.</p></li>
<li><p>True authority in the church is cruciform, not hierarchical.</p></li>
</ul>
