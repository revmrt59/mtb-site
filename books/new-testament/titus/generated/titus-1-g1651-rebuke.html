<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A primary verb (<em>elegchì</em>) signifying to find fault with, to correct, or to bring to light. </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
To convict, to refute, or to manifest a person's fault. It describes an intentional confrontation where truth is used to peel back the layers of deception until the sin is laid bare. Thayer's Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Courtroom Advocate:</strong> In Athenian law, <em>elegchì</em> was the process of <strong>cross-examining a witness</strong> to expose their lies. The goal was to reach a "proof" that could not be argued against.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Illuminating Lamp:</strong> In Greek literature, it was used for <strong>bringing a hidden object into the light</strong>. The word picture is of a dark room where someone has hidden filth; the rebuke is the act of turning on the lamp so the dirt can no longer be ignored. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mirror:</strong> Philosophers used it to describe a "moral mirror." Just as a mirror forces a person to see the blemish on their face, <em>elegchì</em> forces the soul to see its own "beastly" behavior. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Rebuke is a primary work of both the <strong>Word of God</strong> and the <strong>Holy Spirit</strong>. Jesus promised that the Spirit would "convict (<em>elegchì</em>) the world of sin" (John 16:8). In the church, it is not an act of hostility but of <strong>restoration</strong>. The ultimate goal of a biblical rebuke is not to shame the person but to lead them to repentance and "soundness" in the faith. </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:13</strong><br />
Paul tells Titus to "rebuke (<em>elegchì</em>) them sharply." Because the Cretans were "liars" and "beasts," a gentle suggestion would be ignored. Titus had to use the "judicial light" of the Gospel to expose their "dishonest gain" and "meaningless talk." The rebuke was the only "knife" sharp enough to cut through their hardened, gluttonous hearts. </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>John 16:8:</strong> "And when He has come, He will <strong>convict</strong> (<em>elegchì</em>) the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ephesians 5:11:</strong> "And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather <strong>expose</strong> (<em>elegchì</em>) them."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 4:2:</strong> "Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. <strong>Convince</strong> (<em>elegchì</em>), rebuke, exhort..." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
The effectiveness of the rebuke depends on the <strong>authority</strong> of the one giving it. Paul tells Titus in 2:15 to "rebuke with all authority." If the elder is not "above reproach" (v. 6), his <em>elegchì</em> will have no power because his own life has not been "brought to the light." BibleRef </p>
