<p><strong>COMMANDMENTS</strong> — (<em>entolô</em>, StrongΓÇÖs G1785)<br />
Refers to a specific order, injunction, or rule of conduct. In this context, it contrasts the life-giving laws of God with the burdensome, unauthorized regulations imposed by men that lead people away from the truth. </p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
From <em>en</em> (in) + <em>tellì</em> (to accomplish or command). It implies an official instruction that is meant to be carried out or brought to completion. Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
An order, a precept, or a decree. While often used for the Ten Commandments, here it refers to <strong>humanly mandated rules</strong>. It describes the "fine print" added by legalists to regulate every detail of life. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Royal Decree:</strong> In civic life, <em>entolô</em> was used for a <strong>kingΓÇÖs official order</strong> to his subjects. To ignore it was an act of treason. By calling these "commandments of men," Paul is showing that these teachers were acting as "fake kings" over the believers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Military Objective:</strong> It was used for <strong>specific orders given to a soldier</strong> for a mission. The word picture is of a soldier who ignores the General's orders to follow the unauthorized "orders" of a fellow private. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Restrictive Fence:</strong> In religious contexts, it was seen as a "fence" built around a holy object. These teachers were building "fences" (rules) where God had given freedom. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Scripture distinguishes between the "Commandment of God" (which is holy and good) and the "commandments of men." When human tradition is elevated to the level of divine law, it makes "the commandment of God of no effect" (Matthew 15:6). These commandments create a "form of godliness" that lacks the power of the Holy Spirit and focuses on external performance rather than internal transformation. </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:14</strong><br />
Paul explicitly calls these <strong>"commandments of men who turn from the truth."</strong> This is the ultimate "red flag": the source of these rules is not God, but people who have already abandoned the Gospel. They used these rules to maintain control over the "households" they were upsetting, replacing the "easy yoke" of Christ with a heavy burden of human legalism. </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Matthew 15:9:</strong> "And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the <strong>commandments</strong> (<em>entolô</em>) of men."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Colossians 2:22:</strong> "...according to the <strong>commandments</strong> (<em>entolô</em>) and doctrines of men?"</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 John 5:3:</strong> "For this is the love of God, that we keep His <strong>commandments</strong> (<em>entolô</em>). And His commandments are not burdensome." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
In Titus 1, these commandments were likely ascetic rules—prohibitions about what to eat, touch, or handle. Paul argues that because the heart of the teacher is "defiled" (v. 15), their commandments are worthless. True obedience is to the <strong>Commandment of Truth</strong>, not the restrictive regulations of religious "beasts" and "liars." BibleRef </p>
