<p><strong>KNOWLEDGE</strong> — (<em>epignìsis</em>, StrongΓÇÖs G1922)<br />
Refers to a precise, experiential, and participatory knowledge. It is not just "knowing about" facts, but a "full-knowledge" that takes possession of the person and results in a changed life. </p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>epi-</em> (upon/intensive) + <em>gnìsis</em> (knowledge). The prefix <em>epi-</em> acts as an intensifier, suggesting a knowledge that is more "focused," "complete," or "deep" than standard <em>gnìsis</em>. Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Precise and correct knowledge; a thorough acquaintance with the truth. In the New Testament, it almost always refers to the knowledge of God or religious truths that have a decisive influence on the soul. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Recognition:</strong> In legal or social contexts, <em>epignìsis</em> was used when you recognized someoneΓÇÖs face or identity after a period of time. It is the moment the "penny drops" and you fully grasp who you are looking at.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Master Craftsman:</strong> While a beginner has <em>gnìsis</em> (basic information), a master craftsman has <em>epignìsis</em>—the deep, intuitive understanding of his craft that comes from years of experience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Destination:</strong> Classical writers used it to describe someone who had reached the "end point" of a search. You have moved past theories and have arrived at the actual reality. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
<em>epignìsis</em> is the goal of the Christian life. Paul rarely prays that people would have "power" or "stuff," but he constantly prays they would have <em>epignìsis</em> (Col 1:9, Eph 1:17). This implies that <strong>spiritual maturity is impossible without deep, accurate knowledge of GodΓÇÖs Word.</strong> Got Questions </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:1</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"...and the <strong>acknowledgment</strong> (epignìsis) of the truth..."</em> Notice that faith and knowledge are linked. In Crete, people had <em>gnìsis</em> (they knew religious stories/myths), but they lacked <em>epignìsis</em>. Their "knowledge" didn't change their behavior. Paul argues that if the knowledge is truly <em>epignìsis</em>, it <strong>must</strong> result in godliness. BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Colossians 1:9:</strong> "...filled with the <strong>knowledge</strong> (<em>epignìsis</em>) of His will in all wisdom..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Peter 1:3:</strong> "...through the <strong>knowledge</strong> (<em>epignìsis</em>) of Him who called us by glory and virtue."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 2:4:</strong> "[God] desires all men to be saved and to come to the <strong>knowledge</strong> (<em>epignìsis</em>) of the truth." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
In the NT, <em>epignìsis</em> is the "antidote" to false teaching. The false teachers in Titus 1:10 offered "meaningless talk," but Paul offered "full-knowledge." You cannot be deceived by a counterfeit if you have a thorough acquaintance with the genuine. </p>
