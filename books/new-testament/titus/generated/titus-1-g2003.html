<p><strong>COMMANDMENT</strong> — (<em>epitagô</em>, StrongΓÇÖs <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2003/kjv/tr/0-1/"><u>G2003</u></a>)<br />
Refers to an authoritative directive or a royal injunction that demands immediate compliance. In Titus 1:3, it emphasizes that PaulΓÇÖs ministry was not a personal career choice but a <strong>divine mandate</strong> issued by the Sovereign God, leaving him with no option but to obey.

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>epitassì</em>, which comes from <em>epi</em> (upon/over) + <em>tassì</em> (to arrange or appoint). It literally means "an appointment placed upon someone." <a href="https://www.preceptaustin.org/titus_13-4"><u>Precept Austin</u></a> </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
An injunction, mandate, or decree. It denotes an official order that carries "authoritativeness." Unlike a suggestion or advice, an <em>epitagô</em> is a legal requirement that binds the recipient to a specific course of action. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Royal Edict:</strong> In secular Greek life, <em>epitagô</em> was used for a <strong>kingΓÇÖs formal decree</strong> or a government's official mandate. It was the highest form of communication from a ruler to their subjects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Military Deployment:</strong> It was a military term for <strong>placing a soldier in their proper rank or station</strong>. The word picture is of a General "ordering" a soldier to a specific post; the soldier does not negotiate his position but occupies it because of the <em>epitagô</em>. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Irresistible Force:</strong> It evokes the image of a <strong>formal commission</strong> given to a diplomat. The diplomat does not speak for himself; he is "under orders" (<em>epitagô</em>) and must represent his governmentΓÇÖs interests perfectly. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
GodΓÇÖs commandment is the source of all legitimate spiritual authority. PaulΓÇÖs mission was not based on human ambition but on <strong>divine compulsion</strong>. An <em>epitagô</em> from God is both an honor and a heavy responsibility—it means the "steward" (v. 3) is not free to innovate or abandon the message. It underscores that the Gospel is a royal edict from the King of Kings. <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-3.html"><u>BibleRef</u></a> </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:3</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"...which was committed to me according to the <strong>commandment</strong> (epitagô) of God our Savior."</em> Paul is answering the "Why?" of his life. He preaches because he was <strong>ordered</strong> to do so by the highest possible Authority. In the "insubordinate" (v. 10) culture of Crete, PaulΓÇÖs authority to appoint elders (v. 5) rested on the fact that he was acting under a direct <em>epitagô</em> from God Himself. Precept Austin </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 1:1:</strong> "Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the <strong>commandment</strong> (<em>epitagô</em>) of God our Savior..." <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201%3A5-12&amp;version=NKJV"><u>NKJV</u></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Romans 16:26:</strong> "...according to the <strong>commandment</strong> (<em>epitagô</em>) of the everlasting God, made known to all nations..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Titus 2:15:</strong> "Speak these things, exhort, and rebuke with all <strong>authority</strong> (<em>epitagô</em>). Let no one despise you." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a profound contrast between the <em>epitagô</em> (God's order) and the "commandments of men" (<em>entolô</em>) in verse 14. PaulΓÇÖs authority is rooted in a <strong>sovereign decree</strong>, while the false teachersΓÇÖ authority is rooted in <strong>human fables</strong>. One leads to godliness; the other leads to the "upsetting of households" (v. 11). BibleRef </p>
