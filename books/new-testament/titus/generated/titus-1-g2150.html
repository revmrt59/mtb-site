<p><strong>GODLINESS</strong> — (<em>eusebeia</em>, StrongΓÇÖs G2150)<br />
Refers to a life characterized by a proper attitude toward God, resulting in actions that are pleasing to Him. It is the visible outworking of a heart that is rightly related to its Creator, where "right-belief" produces "right-living." </p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
From <em>eu</em> (well) + <em>sebomai</em> (to worship/revere). It literally means "well-worship" or "correct-reverence." It implies an internal devotion that expresses itself in external behavior. </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Piety, devotion, or reverence. It describes a person who is focused on GodΓÇÖs presence and allows that focus to govern their behavior in every sphere of life. It is the practical side of religion as opposed to mere theory. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Civic Duty:</strong> In secular Greek life, <em>eusebeia</em> was the virtue of <strong>giving both gods and men their due</strong>. It was used to describe a "good citizen" who respected the social and religious order of the city.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Plumb Line:</strong> A word picture often associated with it is a <strong>balanced scale</strong>. A godly person is one whose life is "balanced" by the weight of GodΓÇÖs glory, keeping them from tipping into sin or lawlessness. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Altar Fire:</strong> It evokes the image of a <strong>perpetual flame</strong> on an altar—a constant, steady devotion that never goes out, regardless of the weather or circumstances. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Godliness is the "test of truth." If a doctrine is true, it will inevitably produce <em>eusebeia</em>. In the New Testament, it is never just "morality" (being a good person); it is a <strong>God-centered life</strong>. It is the bridge between <strong>creed</strong> (what we believe) and <strong>conduct</strong> (how we live). Without godliness, "knowledge" is merely intellectual pride. </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:1</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"...and the acknowledgment of the truth which accords with <strong>godliness</strong> (eusebeia)..."</em> Paul is setting a standard for the Cretan churches. Any "truth" that does not produce godliness is not the Gospel. Because the island was full of "lazy gluttons" (v. 12), the visible evidence of <em>eusebeia</em> was the most powerful argument for the truth of PaulΓÇÖs message. BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 4:8:</strong> "...but <strong>godliness</strong> (<em>eusebeia</em>) is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Peter 1:6:</strong> "...to perseverance <strong>godliness</strong> (<em>eusebeia</em>), to godliness brotherly kindness..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Peter 3:11:</strong> "...what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and <strong>godliness</strong> (<em>eusebeia</em>)..." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
In the Pastoral Epistles, "The Mystery of Godliness" is Christ Himself (1 Tim 3:16). Therefore, to be godly is to be <strong>Christ-like</strong>. For the Cretans, who were famous for being "always liars," the transformation into "godly" people was a miracle that proved the power of the Gospel. </p>
