<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A primary verb (<em>leipì</em>) meaning to leave, to forsake, or to be destitute. It describes a "deficit" or a "falling short" of a required standard. </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
To leave behind; to be wanting or to fail. In the New Testament, it is often used for a <strong>lack of resources</strong> or a <strong>lack of maturity</strong>. In the context of Titus, it refers specifically to the organizational and leadership deficiencies in the Cretan churches. </p>

<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Unfinished Journey:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>leipì</em> was used for a traveler who <strong>abandoned the road</strong> or fell behind the rest of the group. The church in Crete was "falling behind" because it lacked the leadership to keep it on the right path.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Defective Machine:</strong> It described a mechanism where a <strong>crucial part was missing</strong>. A clock without a gear or a ship without a rudder is <em>leipì</em>—it exists, but it cannot function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Rear Guard:</strong> In military terms, it referred to troops <strong>left behind</strong> or "missing in action." Paul had moved on, but there were vital "rear guard" elements of church order that were still missing. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
GodΓÇÖs desire for His people is <strong>wholeness</strong> (<em>teleios</em>). When things are "lacking," the church is vulnerable to the "tornado" of false teaching (v. 10). <em>Leipì</em> reminds us that a church is not fully "set in order" just because people have believed the Gospel; it must also have the "missing pieces" of leadership and discipline to protect that faith. </p>

<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:5</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"...that you should set in order the things that are <strong>lacking</strong> (leipì)..."</em> The primary "lack" Paul has in mind is the <strong>plurality of elders</strong>. Without godly overseers, the "crooked" culture of Crete (v. 12) was infiltrating the church. TitusΓÇÖs job was to "fill the gap" by identifying and appointing qualified men. </p>

<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>James 1:4:</strong> "...that you may be perfect and complete, <strong>lacking</strong> (<em>leipì</em>) nothing."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>James 1:5:</strong> "If any of you <strong>lacks</strong> (<em>leipì</em>) wisdom, let him ask of God..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Luke 18:22:</strong> "You still <strong>lack</strong> (<em>leipì</em>) one thing. Sell all that you have..." </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a link between <em>leipì</em> and the "unfinished" nature of a young church. Paul shows great humility by allowing Titus to finish the work he started. It suggests that ministry is a <strong>relay race</strong>; one person may plant, but another must come to provide the "missing" structure. </p>
