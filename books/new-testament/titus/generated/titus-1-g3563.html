<p><strong>MIND</strong> — (<em>nous</em>, StrongΓÇÖs G3563)<br />
Refers to the faculty of perception, understanding, and moral judgment. It is the "control center" of the human soul where information is processed, values are weighed, and decisions are made. </p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
From the primary root <em>noos</em> (mind). It signifies the seat of reflective consciousness, comprising the faculties of both the intellect and the moral sentiment. Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
The mind, the reason, or the intellect. In the New Testament, <em>nous</em> is not just the "brain" or the ability to do math; it is the <strong>organ of spiritual perception</strong>. It is the capacity to recognize GodΓÇÖs truth and apply it to life. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Pilot of the Soul:</strong> Greek philosophers (like Plato) often described the <em>nous</em> as the <strong>pilot or helmsman</strong> of a ship. While the "passions" (emotions) were like the wind and waves, the <em>nous</em> was responsible for steering the person toward virtue.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Eye of the Heart:</strong> It was frequently called the <strong>"eye of the soul."</strong> Just as the physical eye allows us to see the world, the <em>nous</em> is the "lens" through which we "see" or understand spiritual and moral realities. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Sieve:</strong> It functions as a <strong>filter</strong>. A healthy <em>nous</em> "sieves" out lies and keeps the truth; a "defiled" <em>nous</em> lets the truth fall through and keeps the "fables." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
The mind is the primary target of GodΓÇÖs redemptive work. Salvation involves a "renewal of the <strong>mind</strong>" (Romans 12:2). However, because of the Fall, the human <em>nous</em> can be "reprobate" or "darkened." When the mind is functioning correctly under the Spirit, it is the "Mind of Christ"; when it is corrupted, it becomes an engine for self-deception and sin. </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:15</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"even their <strong>mind</strong> (nous) and conscience are defiled."</em> Paul is explaining why the false teachers are so dangerous: their <strong>"helmsman" is drunk on sin</strong>. Because their faculty of perception is "stained" (defiled), they literally cannot see the Gospel correctly. They look at the "pure" grace of God and see it as something "unclean" or "insufficient," leading them to create their own man-made rules. </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Romans 12:2:</strong> "...be transformed by the renewing of your <strong>mind</strong> (<em>nous</em>)..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Philippians 4:7:</strong> "...and the peace of God... will guard your hearts and <strong>minds</strong> (<em>nous</em>) through Christ Jesus."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Corinthians 2:16:</strong> "For 'who has known the <strong>mind</strong> (<em>nous</em>) of the Lord...?' But we have the <strong>mind</strong> (<em>nous</em>) of Christ." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
The defilement of the <em>nous</em> leads to the defilement of the <strong>conscience</strong>. When the "eye" (mind) is dark, the "compass" (conscience) becomes unreadable. In Crete, the false teachers had used their intellectual "mind-power" to create "fables," proving that a brilliant <em>nous</em> without a holy heart is merely a tool for deception. <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-15.html"><u>BibleRef</u></a> </p>
