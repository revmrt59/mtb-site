Refers to a manager of a household or estate who handles affairs on behalf of the owner.

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A compound word from <em>oikos</em> (house) + <em>nemì</em> (to dispense or manage). It literally means "house-distributor" or "manager of the household." Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
The manager of a household or of household affairs; a superintendent. It describes a person who has been granted authority by a master to oversee his property, finances, and other servants. The steward owns nothing but manages everything. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Trusted Slave:</strong> In Greco-Roman society, the <em>oikonomos</em> was often a <strong>highly educated slave</strong> or freedman. He held the keys to the granary and the treasury. The word picture is of a man carrying a <strong>heavy ring of keys</strong>—he has access to all the master's wealth, but only to distribute it according to the master's will. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The ShipΓÇÖs Purser:</strong> It was used for the official on a ship responsible for the <strong>provisions and cargo</strong>. If he was unfaithful, the crew would starve or the owner would go bankrupt.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The City Treasurer:</strong> In civic life (like Erastus in Romans 16:23), it was a title for a <strong>high-ranking official</strong> who managed the cityΓÇÖs public funds. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Leadership is a <strong>sacred trust</strong>, not a personal possession. The "Bishop" (Overseer) is a "Steward of God." This implies that the church belongs to God, the message belongs to God, and the people belong to God. The leaderΓÇÖs primary virtue must be <strong>faithfulness</strong> (1 Cor 4:2). He is an "accountable agent" who will one day have to "give an account of his stewardship" (Luke 16:2). BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:7</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"...as a <strong>steward</strong> (oikonomos) of God..."</em> Paul uses this to explain why the qualifications are so high. You wouldn't hire a "self-willed" or "greedy" man (v. 7) to manage your bank account; why would God hire such a man to manage His church? In Crete, where people were "lazy gluttons" (v. 12), a "Steward" stood out as someone who lived for the <strong>Master's profit</strong>, not his own "dishonest gain" (v. 11). <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a> </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Corinthians 4:1:</strong> "Let a man so consider us, as servants of Christ and <strong>stewards</strong> (<em>oikonomos</em>) of the mysteries of God." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Peter 4:10:</strong> "...as good <strong>stewards</strong> (<em>oikonomos</em>) of the manifold grace of God."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Luke 12:42:</strong> "And the Lord said, 'Who then is that faithful and wise <strong>steward</strong> (<em>oikonomos</em>)...?'" </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
The <em>oikonomos</em> must be <strong>"blameless."</strong> If the manager is corrupt, the entire household suffers. Paul insists that the elder's domestic management (v. 6) is the "resume" for his divine stewardship. If he cannot manage his own <em>oikos</em> (house), he is disqualified from being an <em>oikonomos</em> of God's house. Precept Austin </p>
