<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>orgô</em>, which refers to a settled, abiding anger or "wrath." It is a state of mind that has "ripened" into indignation. Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Irascible, prone to anger, or passionate. It does not just describe a single outburst, but a <strong>disposition</strong> toward anger. It identifies a man who is "ready to fly into a passion" at the slightest provocation. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Smoldering Fire:</strong> Aristotle used <em>orgilos</em> for a man who <strong>nursed his anger</strong> and was difficult to appease. The word picture is of a slow-burning fire that produces toxic smoke and can flare up into a blaze at any moment. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Fermenting Must:</strong> It evokes the image of <strong>fermenting wine</strong> (must) that is bubbling and building pressure. If there is no vent for the "gas," the vessel will eventually explode.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Trigger-Happy Soldier:</strong> In military terms, it described someone with a "quick thumb" on their weapon—someone whose lack of restraint made them a danger to their own unit during a tense standoff. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
"The wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God" (James 1:20). An elder must represent the "God of all patience." If a leader is <em>orgilos</em>, he uses <strong>fear and intimidation</strong> to lead rather than love and truth. Anger is often the result of "self-will" (<em>authadôs</em>) being challenged; when we don't get our way, we get angry. A "quick-tempered" man cannot be a "steward of God" because he is a slave to his own emotions. BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:7</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"...not self-willed, not <strong>quick-tempered</strong> (orgilos)..."</em> Paul is building a profile of self-control. In the "beastly" culture of Crete (v. 12), violence and hot-headedness were common. An elderΓÇÖs <strong>calmness</strong> was his greatest credential. If he was quick-tempered, he would "upset households" (v. 11) with his tongue just as easily as the false teachers did with their fables. <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a> </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Note: This specific adjective is used only once in the NT (Titus 1:7). However, its root <strong>orgô</strong> is frequent:</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>James 1:19:</strong> "...let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to <strong>wrath</strong> (<em>orgô</em>)." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 22:24 (LXX):</strong> "Make no friendship with an <strong>angry</strong> (<em>orgilos</em>) man..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Colossians 3:8:</strong> "But now you yourselves are to put off all these: <strong>anger</strong> (<em>orgô</em>), wrath, malice..." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a link between <em>orgilos</em> and the ability to <strong>"refute"</strong> (v. 9). To correct a false teacher, one must have "cool" logic and "hot" truth. If the elder gets "hot" (angry), he loses his ability to persuade. "A soft answer turns away wrath," but a <em>orgilos</em> leader only adds fuel to the fire. Precept Austin </p>
