<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A compound verb from <em>para</em> (beside) + <em>kaleì</em> (to call). It literally means "to call alongside." Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
To admonish, entreat, or beseech; to comfort or encourage. It describes a multi-faceted form of speech that varies according to the need: it can be a gentle "comforting" for the discouraged or a strong "urging" for the sluggish. It is the root of <em>Paraklôtos</em> (Comforter/Helper), a title for the Holy Spirit. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Military Commander:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>parakaleì</em> was used for a <strong>general addressing his troops</strong> before a battle. He "calls them alongside" to remind them of their training and to stir their courage for the coming fight. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Courtroom Advocate:</strong> It was used for an <strong>advocate or "legal helper"</strong> who stands beside the accused in court to speak on their behalf or provide support.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Coach:</strong> A word picture associated with it is a <strong>coach running alongside a marathon runner</strong>. He doesn't run the race for them, but his presence and "shouts of encouragement" provide the runner with the strength to continue. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
God is the "God of all comfort (<em>paraklôsis</em>)" (2 Cor 1:3). For an elder to "exhort" means he is acting as the "voice of the Comforter" to the church. It is the "gentle" side of his authority. Because the elder is "separated" (<em>hagios</em>) to God, he doesn't just bark orders; he "beseeches" and "entreats" based on the mercies of God. It is a ministry of <strong>spiritual companionship</strong>. BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:9</strong><br />
The <strong>NKJV</strong> says: <em>"...that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both to <strong>exhort</strong> (parakaleì) and convict..."</em> Paul presents this as the "positive" work of the elder. In Crete, the believers were under constant pressure from a "beastly" culture. They didn't just need rules; they needed someone to "call them alongside" and show them how the "sound doctrine" applied to their daily struggles. <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a> </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Romans 12:1:</strong> "I <strong>beseech</strong> (<em>parakaleì</em>) you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God..." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hebrews 10:25:</strong> "...but <strong>exhorting</strong> (<em>parakaleì</em>) one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Thessalonians 4:18:</strong> "Therefore <strong>comfort</strong> (<em>parakaleì</em>) one another with these words." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a necessary balance in verse 9: <strong>Exhort</strong> (Positive/Building up) and <strong>Convict</strong> (Negative/Tearing down). An elder who only exhorts will leave the church vulnerable to wolves; an elder who only convicts will bruise the sheep. The "able" leader knows how to use the Word to be a "Helper" to the faithful while being a "Hinderer" to the false. Precept Austin </p>
