<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>peithì</em> (to persuade or be persuaded). It is the state of being fully convinced that something is true and acting upon that conviction. Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Belief, trust, or fidelity. In the New Testament, it signifies both the <em>act</em> of believing (personal trust) and the <em>content</em> of what is believed (the "Faith"). It is a firm persuasion based upon hearing GodΓÇÖs Word. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Legal Guarantee:</strong> In Greek commerce, <em>pistis</em> was a <strong>legal contract or a warranty</strong>. It was the "title deed" that proved ownership of something not yet seen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Persuaded Mind:</strong> Philosophers used it to describe a state of <strong>intellectual certainty</strong> where doubt had been removed. It wasn't "blind faith" but "reasoned trust" based on the character of the one speaking. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Anchor:</strong> A common word picture was that of a <strong>steadying hand or an anchor</strong>. In the shifting sands of human opinion, <em>pistis</em> is the "hold" that keeps the soul from drifting. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Biblical faith is not a human work but a <strong>response to God's revelation</strong>. It is the "instrument" by which we receive grace. In Titus, Paul emphasizes that faith is not a static event but a growing reality. True <em>pistis</em> is always linked to "knowledge of the truth" (v. 1), meaning that as we know God more, our trust in Him deepens and matures. </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:1</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"...according to the <strong>faith</strong> (pistis) of GodΓÇÖs elect..."</em> Paul is stating the <strong>purpose</strong> of his apostleship. He doesn't just want to "convert" people; he wants to build up, protect, and "further" the faith of those God has called. His ministry is dedicated to ensuring that the "faith" of the church in Crete remains pure and unshakable in the face of false teachers. BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Hebrews 11:1:</strong> "Now <strong>faith</strong> (<em>pistis</em>) is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ephesians 2:8:</strong> "For by grace you have been saved through <strong>faith</strong> (<em>pistis</em>)..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jude 1:3:</strong> "...contend earnestly for the <strong>faith</strong> (<em>pistis</em>) which was once for all delivered to the saints." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
In the Pastoral Epistles, "The Faith" often refers to the <strong>standard of sound doctrine</strong>. To be "sound in the faith" (v. 13) means to be healthy in oneΓÇÖs understanding of the Gospel. PaulΓÇÖs goal is to move the Cretans from "fables" to "faith"—from man-made stories to God-given certainty. </p>
