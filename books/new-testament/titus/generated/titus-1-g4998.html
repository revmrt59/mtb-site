<p><strong>SOBER-MINDED</strong> — (<em>sìphrìn</em>, StrongΓÇÖs G4998)<br />
Refers to a person who is of a sound mind, exercising sensible self-restraint and discretion. In <strong>Titus 1:8</strong>, it identifies the elder as one who has his "wits about him," possessing the mental clarity and emotional balance necessary to govern himself and the church without being swayed by passion or impulse.

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A compound word from <em>sìs</em> (safe/sound) and <em>phrôn</em> (the mind). It literally means "safe-minded" or "of a sound mind." Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Self-controlled, level-headed, or sensible. It describes a person who has mastery over their desires and passions, allowing reason and the Spirit to sit on the "throne" of the mind. In the New Testament, it is the opposite of being intoxicated by drink, ego, or emotion. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Charioteer:</strong> In Greek philosophy (such as Plato), <em>sìphrìn</em> was compared to a <strong>skilled charioteer</strong> who keeps a firm grip on the reins of two wild horses (the passions). The horses are strong, but the driver is "sound-minded" and stays on the path. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Calm Sea:</strong> A word picture often associated with this is a <strong>surface of water that is perfectly still</strong>. Because there are no ripples of "passion," the water can perfectly reflect the light of the sun (the Truth).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Healthy Body:</strong> It evokes the image of <strong>"mental hygiene."</strong> Just as a "safe" body is free from infection, a "sober-minded" person has a mind free from the "fever" of lust, greed, or anger. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Sober-mindedness is a fruit of spiritual maturity. Because the world is "intoxicated" with sin and deception, the Christian must be "sober" to see reality as God sees it. Since the elder is an "Overseer" (v. 7), he must have <strong>clear vision</strong>. You cannot watch over a flock if you are mentally "blurred" by self-interest or carnal impulses. It is the ability to make "God-centered" decisions in a "self-centered" world. BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:8</strong><br />
The <strong>NKJV</strong> says: <em>"...a lover of what is good, <strong>sober-minded</strong> (sìphrìn), just..."</em> Paul highlights this virtue because the Cretans were culturally "lazy gluttons" (v. 12)—people who lived for the "belly" and lacked all mental restraint. The elderΓÇÖs <strong>sensibility</strong> was his defense against the "Jewish fables" (v. 14). If he was not sober-minded, he would be easily "mind-deceived" by the false teachers. <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a> </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 3:2:</strong> "A bishop then must be... <strong>sober-minded</strong> (<em>sìphrìn</em>), of good behavior..." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Titus 2:2:</strong> "...that the older men be... <strong>temperate</strong> (<em>sìphrìn</em>—translated as 'sober-minded' or 'temperate' in NKJV)."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Titus 2:5:</strong> "...to be <strong>discreet</strong> (<em>sìphrìn</em>), chaste, homemakers..." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
In the book of Titus, the root <em>sìphron-</em> appears in every chapter (1:8, 2:2, 2:4, 2:5, 2:6, 2:12). It is the <strong>key theme of the letter</strong>. PaulΓÇÖs solution to the "wildness" of Crete is the "safe-mindedness" of the Gospel. An elder is the primary example of what it looks like when the grace of God "teaches us" to live "soberly" (2:12).
