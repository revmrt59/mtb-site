<p><strong>Titus 1:5</strong> <em>… appoint elders in every city as I commanded you-</em>(NKJV)</p>
<p><strong>1. Elders Oversee the Affairs of the Church</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elders are called to oversee and care for the local church, watching over both the direction of the church and the souls of God’s people. Their authority is exercised for the benefit of others, not personal gain.</p>

</ul>

<li><p><strong>Hebrews 13:17</strong> - “They watch out for your souls…”</p></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>7. Elders Guard and Protect the Flock</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>11. Elders Devote Themselves to Prayer</strong></p>

<li><p><strong>James 5:14</strong> - “Call for the elders… let them pray”</p></li>
