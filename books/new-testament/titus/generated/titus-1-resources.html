<p><strong>Titus 1:5</strong> <em>â€¦ appoint elders in every city as I commanded you-</em>(NKJV)</p>
<p><strong>1. Elders Oversee the Affairs of the Church</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elders are called to oversee and care for the local church, watching over both the direction of the church and the souls of Godâ€™s people. Their authority is exercised for the benefit of others, not personal gain.</p>
