          <p><strong>Titus 2</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Unifying Theme</strong></p>
          <p>God’s saving grace produces lives that reflect sound
          teaching, visible godliness, and everyday faithfulness across
          all ages and roles.</p>
          <p><strong>Chapter Outline</strong></p>
          <ol type="1">
          <li><p>Sound doctrine lived out in everyday life (Tit
          2:1–10)</p></li>
          <li><p>God’s grace as the foundation for godly living (Tit
          2:11–14)</p></li>
          <li><p>Authority to teach, exhort, and correct (Tit
          2:15)</p></li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Chapter Summary</strong></p>
          <p>Titus 2 moves from leadership qualifications to everyday
          Christian living. Paul shows that sound doctrine is not only
          something to be believed but something to be lived. Older men,
          older women, younger women, younger men, and servants are all
          addressed directly. Each group is called to live in a way that
          makes the teaching about God attractive and credible. At the
          center of the chapter is the grace of God, which does not
          excuse sin but trains believers to live self-controlled,
          upright, and godly lives as they wait for Christ’s return.</p>
          <p><strong>Theological Contributions of This
          Chapter</strong></p>
          <p>• Doctrine and daily life are inseparable. What is taught
          must be seen.<br />
          • God’s grace is not passive forgiveness but active
          training.<br />
          • Christian conduct affects how the message of God is received
          by the world.<br />
          • The return of Christ motivates holy living in the
          present.</p>
          <p><strong>Key Words and Concepts</strong></p>
          <p>Sound doctrine: Teaching that is healthy, reliable, and
          consistent with the gospel.<br />
          Godliness: A way of life shaped by God’s grace that reflects
          reverence for God in everyday behavior. Godliness reflects a
          life that is “wholly His”.<br />
          Self-control: Strength under control, applied across every
          stage of life.<br />
          Grace of God: God’s unearned favor that saves and actively
          trains believers to live rightly.<br />
          Good works: Visible evidence of a transformed life that
          supports the credibility of the gospel.<br />
          Blessed hope: The confident expectation of Christ’s return
          that motivates faithful living now.</p>
          <p><strong>Why This Chapter Matters</strong></p>
          <p>Titus 2 shows that the gospel reaches into ordinary life.
          Faith is not limited to church settings or leadership roles.
          God cares how older believers live, how younger believers
          grow, and how daily responsibilities are handled. When
          believers live changed lives in normal relationships, the
          truth of the gospel becomes believable and compelling to
          others.</p>
          <p><strong>High-Level Chapter Lessons</strong></p>
          <p>• Healthy teaching should produce healthy living.<br />
          • God’s grace trains believers, not just forgives them.<br />
          • Every believer’s life either supports or undermines the
          gospel message.<br />
          • Hope in Christ’s return encourages faithfulness today.</p>
