          <p><strong>Chapter Summary</strong></p>
          <p>Titus 3 turns outward to how believers live in the world
          and within the church. Paul reminds believers to be submissive
          to governing authorities, gentle toward others, and ready for
          good works. He grounds this call in the reality of salvation.
          Believers were once sinful and lost, but God saved them
          through His mercy, not through righteous deeds. This salvation
          brings new life through the Holy Spirit. Because of this,
          believers are to focus on good works and avoid foolish
          disputes and divisive behavior that harm the church’s
          witness.</p>
          <p><strong>Theological Contributions of This
          Chapter</strong></p>
          <p>• Salvation is entirely the result of God’s mercy and
          grace.<br />
          • Good works flow from salvation but do not earn it.<br />
          • The Holy Spirit brings renewal and new life.<br />
          • Unity in the church must be guarded against division and
          strife.</p>
          <p><strong>Key Words and Concepts</strong></p>
          <p>Mercy: God’s compassionate action toward those who deserve
          judgment.<br />
          Regeneration: The new birth in which God gives spiritual life
          to those who were spiritually dead.<br />
          Renewal: The ongoing inner transformation produced by the Holy
          Spirit.<br />
          Justification: God’s declaration that a sinner is righteous
          through faith, not works.<br />
          Good works: The fruit of salvation that benefits others and
          honors God.<br />
          Unity: Peaceful cooperation among believers that protects the
          church’s witness.</p>
          <p><strong>Why This Chapter Matters</strong></p>
          <p>Titus 3 helps believers understand how the gospel shapes
          public life and church life. Christians are called to live
          humbly in society while holding firmly to the truth of
          salvation by grace. This chapter guards against pride,
          legalism, and division by keeping the focus on what God has
          done and how His people should live in response.</p>
          <p><strong>High-Level Chapter Lessons</strong></p>
          <p>• Salvation is based on God’s mercy, not human
          effort.<br />
          • Good works are the fruit of salvation, not its
          foundation.<br />
          • The Holy Spirit renews and empowers believers for new
          life.<br />
          • Divisiveness damages both the church and its witness.</p>
