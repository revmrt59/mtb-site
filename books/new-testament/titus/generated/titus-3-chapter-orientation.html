          <h3 id="unifying-theme">Unifying Theme</h3>
          <p>God’s saving mercy produces humble, obedient lives that do
          good works and protect the unity of the church.</p>
          <h3 id="purpose-of-this-chapter">Purpose of This Chapter:</h3>
          <p>Titus 3 clarifies how the gospel transforms believers’
          relationship to authority, society, and one another. Paul
          reminds the church that salvation is entirely the result of
          God’s mercy, not human righteousness, and that this grace
          produces humility, gentleness, and good works. The chapter
          calls believers to live as a redeemed people who are careful
          to maintain good works, avoid divisive behavior, and reflect
          the kindness and love of God in the world. Right belief must
          lead to right living, protecting both the unity and the
          witness of the church.</p>

          <h3 id="chapter-summary">Chapter Summary</h3>
          <p>Titus 3 turns outward to how believers live in the world
          and within the church. Paul reminds believers to be submissive
          to governing authorities, gentle toward others, and ready for
          good works. He grounds this call in the reality of salvation.
          Believers were once sinful and lost, but God saved them
          through His mercy, not through righteous deeds. This salvation
          brings new life through the Holy Spirit. Because of this,
          believers are to focus on good works and avoid foolish
          disputes and divisive behavior that harm the church’s
          witness.</p>

          <h3 id="why-this-chapter-matters">Why This Chapter
          Matters</h3>
          <p>Titus 3 helps believers understand how the gospel shapes
          public life and church life. Christians are called to live
          humbly in society while holding firmly to the truth of
          salvation by grace. This chapter guards against pride,
          legalism, and division by keeping the focus on what God has
          done and how His people should live in response.</p>
          <h3 id="high-level-chapter-lessons">High-Level Chapter
          Lessons</h3>
          <p>• Salvation is based on God’s mercy, not human
          effort.<br />
          • Good works are the fruit of salvation, not its
          foundation.<br />
          • The Holy Spirit renews and empowers believers for new
          life.<br />
          • Divisiveness damages both the church and its witness.</p>
