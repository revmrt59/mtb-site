<p>Insight: Healthy Teaching vs Bible Teaching</p>
<p>Paul differtiates between “sound” or healthy teaching vs teaching from the Bible. The Judiazers and false teachers were teaching from the Bible but because the teaching was not heathy, the fruit of the teaching, meaning the teachers and the believers was not healthy.</p>
<p>This raises a radical point. You can teach something found in the Bible, but it not be a healthy teaching. You can teach things from the word of God and be an unhealthy teacher.</p>
<p>The question becomes what constitutes “healthy teaching”. I believe Paul answers that first to Timothy and then to Titus.</p>
<p>The Word of God must be used to teach the purpose for which God gave His word.</p>

<h2 id="insight-six-marks-of-spiritual-maturity">Insight: Six Marks of Spiritual Maturity</h2>
<p>In <strong>Titus 2:2</strong>, Paul lists six qualities that should characterize these men. These aren't just personality traits; they are the results of sound doctrine incorporated into a life.</p>
<p>The list can be divided into two categories: <strong>Internal Restraint</strong> and <strong>External Faith.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Internal Restraint (Temperament)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sober-minded:</strong> This literally refers to being "temperate" or moderate in the use of wine, but it carries the broader meaning of being clear-headed. An older man should not be controlled by his physical appetites. They should be clear-headed, not ruled by appetite or impulse.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dignified:</strong> This means being worthy of respect. It doesn—t mean being "stiff" or "humorless," but rather having a serious-mindedness about life and faith that commands the respect of the younger generation. There is weight to their life, having walked decades with the Lord.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-controlled:</strong> This is a key word throughout Titus. It refers to a person who has mastery over their desires, impulses, thoughts, reactions, and speech.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. External Faith (The "Triple Threat" of Health)</strong></p>
<p>Paul concludes the verse by stating that these men must be <strong>"sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness."</strong> Note that he uses the word "sound" (healthy) again here.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sound in Faith:</strong> Their trust in God must be firm and free from the "sickness" of doubt or false teaching. They have unwaivering trust in God, regardless of trials or circumstances. Still bearing fruit in later years. No smell of “smoke— from going through life.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sound in Love:</strong> As men age, there is a natural tendency to become cynical or self-absorbed. Paul insists they must remain healthy in their active, selfless love for others. Also age has not cooled their passion for Jesus.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sound in Steadfastness (Patience):</strong> This is the ability to endure trials and the "long haul" of life without giving up. It is the "staying power" of a mature believer. It is endurance under pressure. The ability to handle trials and pressure well.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Maturity is not age or years in the faith, but manifest health in these areas.</p>
<p><strong>Insight: We all need teachers to grow in our faith</strong></p>
<p>The Christian life is not natural. Believers are not born knowing how to live in a way that pleases God. Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Scripture is necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Instruction is necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Correction is necessary.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Without sound instruction, believers drift toward what “seems right,” which often leads to spiritual harm.</p>
<p>It is important to note the church of Crete was likely founded when believers carried the message back after the day of Pentecost and due to a lack of healthy teaching, the church, believers and families were unhealthy.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><strong>Insight: Our tongues can be the devil—s tool</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slander, Gossip and other sins of the</strong></p>
<p><strong>Insight: Young men need to be taught to be sensible</strong></p>
<p>Young men, while strong, usually are not sensible in decisions, behaviors, and reactions. You can spend a life-time paying for one moment of not being sensible. Young men need to be taught this.</p>
<p>Self-control and sensibility is not personality; it is Spirit-formed strength that prevents lifelong regret.</p>
<p><strong>6. Doctrine at Work — Ordered Strength Under Authority</strong></p>
<p>Bondservants are instructed to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Be submissive (not rebellious in spirit)</p></li>
<li><p>Not argumentative</p></li>
<li><p>Not steal</p></li>
<li><p>Show full trustworthiness</p></li>
<li><p>Work with excellence</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Christianity does not produce rebellion of spirit but ordered strength. Even under imperfect authority, believers respond faithfully.</p>
<p><strong>8. The Transformative Nature of Grace</strong></p>
<p>Saving grace is not merely pardon. It is a school.</p>
<p>Grace:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Brings salvation</p></li>
<li><p>Trains us to renounce ungodliness</p></li>
<li><p>Teaches sober, righteous, godly living</p></li>
<li><p>Empowers transformation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If grace only forgives, Titus 2 becomes moral pressure.<br />
If grace empowers, Titus 2 becomes possible.</p>
<p><strong>9. The Redemptive Purpose of Christ</strong></p>
<p>Christ gave Himself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To redeem from lawlessness</p></li>
<li><p>To purify a people for His own possession</p></li>
<li><p>To produce zeal for good works</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Redemption is not only rescue from penalty but purification for purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Insight. Pastoral Authority and Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>Titus is commanded to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Speak</p></li>
<li><p>Exhort</p></li>
<li><p>Rebuke</p></li>
<li><p>Do so with authority</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Pastoral leadership includes corrective clarity.<br />
Correction is for restoration, not humiliation.<br />
Despising correction leads to disorder. Receiving it leads to health.</p>
<p>Spiritual health in a church often flows from the integrity and courage of its leaders.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaways — What Stays With the Reader</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Doctrine is either healthy or unhealthy; it always produces something.</p></li>
<li><p>Grace trains as well as forgives.</p></li>
<li><p>Maturity is measurable in faith, love, and endurance.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrity is consistent across environments.</p></li>
<li><p>You live under the gaze of God, not the applause of men.</p></li>
<li><p>Christianity affects dishwashers, job sites, conversations, and attitudes.</p></li>
<li><p>Leadership carries weight; what leaders tolerate becomes culture.</p></li>
<li><p>If grace empowers, obedience becomes joyful possibility.</p></li>
<li><p>A life that fits the gospel strengthens its credibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Functional excellence is both useful and beautiful—good in action and character.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Seeds — Truths Meant to Grow Over Time</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. The Blessed Hope</strong></p>
<p>Present endurance is sustained by eager expectation of the appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. Hope fuels holiness.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Triple Threat of Health</strong></p>
<p>Being sound in faith, love, and steadfastness becomes increasingly powerful over time. Spiritual health deepens rather than fades with age.</p>
<p><strong>3. Inward Purity Over Outward Religion</strong></p>
<p>Healthy doctrine produces purity of heart.<br />
Unhealthy doctrine replaces inward transformation with rituals, speculation, or man-made commands.</p>
<p><strong>4. Ordered Strength</strong></p>
<p>Submission under authority is not weakness.<br />
It is disciplined strength governed by Christ.</p>
<p><strong>5. Grace + Faith Is the Lifelong Pattern</strong></p>
<p>The way you were saved is the way you grow.<br />
Conviction ΓåÆ repentance ΓåÆ faith ΓåÆ grace.<br />
This pattern never becomes obsolete.</p>
<p><strong>6. The Purpose of All Instruction</strong></p>
<p>The end goal of biblical teaching is love that flows from:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A pure heart</p></li>
<li><p>A clear conscience</p></li>
<li><p>Genuine faith</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When teaching does not produce this, it is not healthy.</p>
<p><strong>8. The Ordinary Is Sacred</strong></p>
<p>Homes, workplaces, and everyday routines are stages where Christ is displayed or denied.</p>
<p><strong>Reflections — Space for Self-Examination and Response</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does my daily conduct align with what I claim to believe?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I the same person Monday morning as Sunday morning?</p></li>
<li><p>Do I allow Scripture to correct me, or do I resist uncomfortable truth?</p></li>
<li><p>Have I reduced grace to forgiveness while resisting its training power?</p></li>
<li><p>Is my speech healthy and life-giving?</p></li>
<li><p>Do I respond faithfully under authority, or with quiet rebellion?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I merely complying, or truly zealous for good works?</p></li>
<li><p>Has unhealthy teaching shaped my expectations, frustrations, or disappointments?</p></li>
<li><p>Do I welcome pastoral correction, or do I disregard the messenger?</p></li>
<li><p>Is my life presence-driven, responsive to the Spirit—s conviction and leading?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ΓÇó Lessons — What the chapter teaches plainly</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Mandate of Sound Doctrine:</strong> Titus is charged to teach "sound" (healthy) doctrine, which stands in direct contrast to the "unhealthy" and "unproductive" teaching of those seeking personal gain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maturity Marks for Men:</strong> Older men are instructed to be sober-minded, dignified, and self-controlled, exhibiting a healthy balance of internal restraint and external faith.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mentorship Model for Women:</strong> Older women are called to be reverent and to actively train younger women in loving their families and managing their homes with kindness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Transformative Nature of Grace:</strong> Saving grace is not merely forgiveness; it is a "school" that trains believers to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions.</p></li>

<p><strong>ΓÇó Takeaways — What stays with the reader</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The "Adorning" Principle:</strong> Our behavior—whether as employees, spouses, or citizens—serves to "adorn" or "beautify" the Gospel, making the character of Christ attractive to the world.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Functional Excellence:</strong> "Good" in the biblical sense (<em>agathos</em> and <em>kalos</em>) refers to a life that is both practically useful and spiritually beautiful, fulfilling its intended purpose.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grace as Empowerment:</strong> If grace only forgives, these instructions become a burden; if grace empowers, a holy life becomes a joyful possibility.</p></li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Living Under the Gaze of God:</strong> Integrity is the same in every sphere (home, office, church) because the believer lives "under the gaze of God" rather than for the applause of men.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Weight of Leadership:</strong> Spiritual health in a church or home is often a "trickle-down" reality; it begins with the integrity and maturity of its leaders.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Correction Response:</strong> Do you allow the Word of God the liberty to speak a "corrective word" into your life, or do you "disregard" the messenger when the truth becomes uncomfortable?.</p></li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Zeal Factor:</strong> Are you merely "complying" with Christian rules, or are you truly "zealous" (on fire) for good works because you belong to Him?.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Presence Check:</strong> Is your life "presence driven," following the Holy Spirit wherever and whenever He leads?.</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Unselfish Life<br />
<br />
Titus 2:9—10 tells servants to be well pleasing in all things. That means they are not to focus on pleasing themselves, but to seek to please their masters first. Paul is telling them to live an unselfish life. Put others first. Think of others first. Consider what others need. Think about how your actions, what you do and do not do, affect others.<br />
<br />
This is radical in a system where you already feel deprived. The pressure point is obvious. When you feel you deserve better, selfishness feels justified. Paul says no. Die to self. Serve.<br />
<br />
We can clearly see why this adorns the gospel. It speaks volumes about Christ.</p>
</div>
<ol type="a">
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>It communicates God—s character. It shows forth the unselfishness of Christ.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>It complements God—s nature. God is a giver. John 3:16 says, “For God so loved the world He gave.” He saves and benefits others through His unselfishness.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>It causes Christ to be more attractive and desirable. In a world where unbelievers and many believers are supremely selfish, there is a God who is unselfish, and He is transforming a people to be unselfish as well. How many people could not love and want a God who is unselfish?</p>
</div></li>
</ol></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Submitted Life<br />
<br />
Titus 2:9 says servants are to be obedient to their own masters, not answering back. The word for obedient carries the idea of placing yourself under. Meaning willingly submitting yourself to all that is required of you, even when it feels unreasonable, so long as it is not immoral.<br />
<br />
Real inward submissiveness, because you have died and your life is now in Christ. Not forced, but natural, because you have died to self-will.<br />
<br />
Again, the pressure point is resentment. When someone has authority over you, especially imperfect authority, the instinct is to resist, to talk back, to push back. Paul addresses that directly.<br />
<br />
How does this adorn the gospel?</p>
</div>
<ol type="a">
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>It communicates Christ. Philippians 2 shows Him humbling Himself and becoming obedient.</p>

<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>It causes Christ to be more attractive. He is Lord. When your life reflects joyful submission to Him, it shows that you trust His rule.</p>

</ol></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="List Paragraph">
<p>Cheerful Life<br />
<br />
Titus 2:9 says to be well pleasing in all things. This goes beyond bare compliance. It means going beyond the call of duty. This speaks of proper disposition. An excellent attitude because you are serving God and because of all He has done.<br />
<br />
It is opposed to murmuring, complaining, self-pity, woe-is-me thinking, sourness, harshness. Instead, it is full of joy and love. God is in control. You are controlled by the Spirit of Christ.<br />

<li><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Text: Titus 2:11-15</p></li>
<li><p>See Insert for introduction.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>What is the Grace of God?</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>We use this term and don—t understand what it means or what is necessary to possess clear grace.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Charis</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Charis</em> comes from a word meaning to “be happy, cheerful or well off”</p></li>
<li><p>Classical meaning of <em>CHARIS</em> in the Greek</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><em>Something that has joy, beauty</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Speaking of the person possessing such a thing</p></li>
<li><p>Property of joy, beauty or value possessed by someone</p></li>
<li><p>Something incredible or noteworthy to look upon</p></li>
<li><p>John Wesley correcting the swearing military man</p></li>
<li><p>Jesus was full of grace and truth</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>Favor freely done</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Bestowing of the thing of beauty and joy</p></li>
<li><p>Communication of the favor</p></li>
<li><p>In the terminology of the Greek schools charis implied ”a favor freely done, without claim or expectation or return”.</p></li>
<li><p>Aristotle in defining charis, lays the whole stress on this very point, that is conferred freely, with no expectation of return, and finding its only motive in the bounty and the free-heartedness of the giver.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>Extraordinary act of favor which is to be commended</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Charis was also used to describe an act that was beyond the ordinary course of what might be expected, and was therefore commendable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1Pe 2:19</strong> <em>For this is thankworthy, [GRACE] if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Here Peter uses the word in its meaning of "that which would be beyond the ordinary course of what might be expected and is therefore commendable"</p></li>
<li><p>Surely for slave to manifest patient submission towards a master who mistreats him, is an action beyond the ordinary course of what might be expected.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Paul took this Greek word grace, which meant “<em>a favor freely done</em>” and “<em>an extraordinary act or favor which is to be commended</em>” and applied it to what Christ did for us on the cross.<br />
<br />
The Greek scholar Kenneth Wuest tells us how: “<em>All the human race could expect in view of its sin, was the righteous wrath of a Holy God, and eternal banishment from his glorious presence. But instead, that Holy God stepped down from his judgment seat and took upon himself the guilt and penalty of human sin, thus satisfying his justice and making possible bestowal of his mercy. And this he did, not for those who are his friends, but his bitter enemies, unlovely creatures saturated with sin. Charis in classical Greek referred to a favor conferred freely, with no expectation of return, and finding its only motive in the bounty and free-heartedness of the giver. <u>His favor was always done to a friend, never to an enemy</u>. Right here charis leaps forward an infinite distance, for the Lord Jesus died for his enemies (Rom 5:8-10), a thing unheard of in the human race. Surely this is beyond the ordinary course of what might be expected and is commendable. This is what John means in 1John 3:1 when he said “Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God”. Thus the word grace comes to its highest and most exalted meaning in the New Testament. It refers to God's offer of salvation with all that it implies, which salvation was procured at Calvary—s cross with all the personal sacrifice which that included, offered to one who is his bitter enemy and who is not only on deserving of that salvation, but deserves eternal punishment for his sins, offered without any expectation of return, but given out of the bounty and free-heartedness of the giver</em>.”</p></li>
<li><p>Grace</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Simply means - “an undeserved blessing freely bestowed”</p></li>
<li><p>God—s undeserved favor and blessing, freely bestowed</p></li>
<li><p>Theologically the term “grace of God” refers to the wholly <u>undeserved</u> blessing of salvation freely bestowed upon all who would receive it.</p></li>
<li><p>God—s grace refers to His free and wholly undeserved gift of salvation</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>That helps answer and lead into the next question which is, “what is the purpose of God—s grace.”</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>The Purpose of Grace</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:11</strong> <em>For the grace of God that <u>bringeth salvation</u> hath appeared to all men,</em> (KJV)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The purpose of grace is “<em>To bring salvation</em>”</p></li>
<li><p>The purpose for God sending His son is not for any other reason than to bring salvation</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>What is Salvation?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The word save or salvation is the Greek word “sozo”</p></li>
<li><p>Thayer—s Definition</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>To save, to keep safe and sound, to rescue from danger or destruction, injury or peril</p></li>
<li><p>To save a suffering one from perishing</p></li>
<li><p>To make well, heal, restore to health</p></li>
<li><p>To preserve one who is in danger of destruction, to save or rescue</p></li>
<li><p>To deliver from the penalties of the Messianic judgment</p></li>
<li><p>To save from the evils which obstruct the reception of the Messianic deliverance</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>For a Christian, salvation is all of those</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Rescue from the danger and destruction of our sins [present and future]</p></li>
<li><p>Rescue us from the suffering from our sins</p></li>
<li><p>To restore and heal the damage from living in this sin-fallen world</p></li>
<li><p>To save and deliver us from God—s Wrath against sin</p></li>
<li><p>To save us from everything within ourselves that hinders the reception of what Christ has done.</p></li>
<li><p>Save us from God—s judgment of our sins</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Scope of Salvation</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>Penalty of Sin</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>A holy God must judge and penalize sin</p></li>
<li><p>In order for God to be true to Himself, He must condemn sin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rom 6:23</strong> <em>For the wages of sin is death; ΓÇª</em>(KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>As sinners, everyone of us stands condemned before the bar of God</p></li>
<li><p>Christ came to save us from the penalty of sin</p></li>
<li><p>Justification by faith <strong>Rom 5:1</strong> <em>Therefore being justified by faithΓÇª</em>(KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Free pardon</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Power of Sin</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>Rom 6:17</strong> <em>But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, ΓÇª</em>(KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Before Christ, we are totally under the power to sin.</p></li>
<li><p>Can not possible choose righteousness</p></li>
<li><p>Bound, under the dominion of sin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:14</strong> <em>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquityΓÇª.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Redemption by His blood, like Israel in Egypt, delivered us from the power of sin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rom 6:14</strong> <em>For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</em>(KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Which simply means, you obey God not because you have to but because you want to and because God is working in your heart.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you want to sin as a Christian, you can, but if you are a real Christian, you won—t want to and if you do, you will feel miserable after until you repent</strong></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Presence of Sin</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:14</strong> <em>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from <u>all</u> iniquity, and purify ΓÇª</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Salvation includes the slow and steady removal of sin nature, day-by-day</p></li>
<li><p>Until the great day, when we pass through the fire of His Holy judgment and sin is completely removed</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Possession of Sin</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Sin owned us.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Eph 2:2</strong> <em>Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Now true believers in Christ are God—s children. His people. His precious possession.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:14</strong> <em>Who gave himself for us, that he might ΓÇª purify unto himself a peculiar peopleΓÇª</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>A believer—s salvation is designed such that God brings him wholly over to himself.</p></li>
<li><p>Not divided, but God and God—s alone.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Which is why salvation in the Bible is spoken of as being in three tenses: past, present, future</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Salvation is spoken of as being past</em></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>Act 16:31</strong> <em>And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.</em></p></li>
<li><p>When a person trusts in Christ and is born-again, they are saved.</p></li>
<li><p>Saved from the penalty of sin</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>Salvation is also spoken of in the NT as being a present process</em></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>I am being saved</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phil 2:12</strong> <em>ΓÇª, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Present aspect to salvation</p></li>
<li><p>We are being saved from the presence and possession of sin</p></li>
<li><p>In our present salvation, God is purifying us and possessing us more wholly in that we are yielding our hearts and affections less unto ourselves and our sins and our idols and more unto Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>Our present salvation affects life now (Tit 2:12)</p></li>
<li><p>Our present salvation affects our future glory (2Cor 5:1)-&gt; we are building something eternal now.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>Future - saved from the presence of sin</em></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>Rom 13:11</strong> <em>And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:13</strong> <em>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 John 3:2</strong> <em>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>This is why we earnestly look for the return of our Lord</p></li>
<li><p>Our salvation will be completed</p></li>
<li><p>We will be free from the vestiges of the old sin nature which so frustrate us</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Salvation in God—s eyes is more than merely fire insurance.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Matt 1:21</strong> <em>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>To save and rescue people from all aspects of sin: penalty, presence, power, possession</p></li>
<li><p>When Paul speaks about the purpose of grace being to bring salvation, he is speaking so much more than is commonly understood by believers.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The purpose of grace is “t<em>o bring salvation</em>”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Not to make you wealthy, but to make you holy</p></li>
<li><p>Not to give you the life that you think you want to live, but rather to cause you to live the life that He wants you to live.</p></li>
<li><p>The purpose of grace is to bring salvation, rescue, deliverance from all aspects of sin.</p></li>
<li><p>Which is why Paul argues that the grace of God which brings salvation leads to the desire for a holy life.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Deep desire for righteousness, shows a deep understanding of God—s purpose for grace</p></li>
<li><p>The converse is true. Ungodly living is a clear sign that either a Christian does not understand God—s grace or does not believe in God—s grace.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>One of the great modern theologians J.I. Packer said this, “There are four crucial truths which the doctrine of grace presupposes, and if they are not acknowledged and felt in ones heart, clear faith in God grace becomes impossible”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>The complete moral bankruptcy of man</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The totally depravity of man</p></li>
<li><p>Or as Packer calls it, “the moral ill-desert of man”</p></li>
<li><p>Because of wealth and technological advances, modern man inclines to a high opinion of himself.</p></li>
<li><p>He refuses to take seriously the idea that morally speaking, there is anything wrong with him</p></li>
<li><p>He tends to dismiss bad conscience and blame everything on chemical reactions in the brain, poverty, parents, upbringing, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Modern man is convinced that despite all his lies, dirt, etc. he is at heart a thoroughly good fellow.</p></li>
<li><p>“And then he imagines God in the image of himself as all pagans do.</p></li>
<li><p>He assumes that God shares his complacency about himself.</p></li>
<li><p>The thought of himself is as a creature fallen from God's image. a rebel, guilty and unclean in God's sight fit only for condemnation never enters his head.</p></li>
<li><p>But the Bible clearly teaches this Isa 64:6, Rom 3:10, Rom 3:23</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>The justice of God</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>In order to receive God—s grace, must recognize God as judge.</p></li>
<li><p>“Modern man turns a blind eye to all wrong doing as long as he safely can. He tolerates in others feeling that it is only there for the accident of circumstances. Parents hesitate to correct their children and teachers punish their pupils and the public puts up with all sorts of anti-social behavior. Punishment is a last resort. Toleration and indulgence of sin is seen as a virtue while living by fixed principles of right and wrong is condemned as being narrow minded and bigoted. The idea that retribution might be the moral law of God's world and an expression of His holy character seems to modern man quite fantastic. Yet the Bible insists that God is the judge of all the earth and He will do right and punishing the law-breakers. God is not true to Himself unless he punishes sin. And unless one knows and feels the truth of this fact, wrongdoers have no natural hope of anything from God but judgment and can never share the Biblical faith in divine grace.”</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>The spiritual impotence of man</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Modern man believes that as long as he is sincere, and comes to God sincerely, God will accept him.</p></li>
<li><p>Modern man believes they can come to God on his own terms.</p></li>
<li><p>Modern man does not want to believe his goodness falls short of God—s perfect standard</p></li>
<li><p>In order to perceive and receive God—s grace properly, must recognize, there is only one way to God.</p></li>
<li><p>Through Christ by faith John 14:6</p></li>
<li><p>Did you ever wonder why God says simple trust in Christ is the only way to be saved?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Even though it is simple, it is not easy</p></li>
<li><p>Man must bow his rebellion, his will, his pride, to admit these things that God says are true</p></li>
<li><p>Its at this point that destiny is determined.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>The Sovereign Freedom of God</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>God is able to act independent of man</p></li>
<li><p>“Ancient paganism thought of each god as bound to his worshippers by bonds of self-interest, because he depended on their service and gifts for his welfare. Modern paganism has at the back of its mind a similar feeling that God is somehow <u>obliged</u> to love and help us.</p></li>
<li><p>"God will forgive, that's His job".</p></li>
<li><p>The God of the Bible does not depend on man for His well-being. God does not owe mercy to anyone.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rom 9:16</strong> <em>So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</em></p></li>
<li><p>God is not obliged to help us, He does out of the free-favor of His grace.</p></li>
<li><p>Even as Christians, we adopt the attitude that God is obliged to love us-&gt; its of grace!</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>I believe it is failure to understand these four crucial truths why:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>People claim to make a profession of faith and seem to fall away</em></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Church has told them they are saved.</p></li>
<li><p>People tell them believe in Christ and you will be saved</p></li>
<li><p>Faith is not intellectual assent, it is a moral persuasion of the heart</p></li>
<li><p>In order to be saved by grace, must perceive real need of grace and we willing to bow the will and heart and trust in Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>Never understood the doctrine of grace</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>Why Christians do not grow or stop growing in godliness</em></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>At some point they start trusting in their own works vs. Christ—s.</p></li>
<li><p>Lose the sense of their moral bankruptcy and impotence.</p></li>
<li><p>Lose sight of the fact that just because they don—t do some of the things they used to, God is not obligated to be merciful, its all of grace.</p></li>
<li><p>Lose sight of the fact that God stills deals with us according to grace, not some measure of respectability that we have achieved.</p></li>
<li><p>Cleaned up enough, (I don—t smoke, drink swear, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>I don—t have to deal with the deeper depravity in my heart.</p></li>
<li><p>Now I am holy and better than Joe</p></li>
<li><p>“I don—t need to be broken, I am saved by grace.”</p></li>
<li><p>Another reason why Christians stop growing in grace, not only do they not perceive the depths of God—s grace, but also they lose sight of the purpose of God—s grace.</p></li>
<li><p>But this makes a mockery of the purpose of God—s grace which is complete sanctification - salvation from the presence of sin.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>When fully understood, it is the gospel of grace that teaches Christians how to live.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:12</strong> <em>Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>The grace of God teaches us (or disciplines us as that is what the Greek word means)</p></li>
<li><p>The grace of God properly understood, promotes godly and holy living.</p></li>
<li><p>This was the whole point Paul was making</p></li>
<li><p><em><strong>For</strong></em>ΓÇª - What changes life, what produces the power, and motivation to change is grace.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The grace of God teaches and disciplines us to godliness in three ways</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>Love</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Proper understanding of His grace presents us with the strongest motives to obedience.</p></li>
<li><p>Calvin: “What changes bind faster and closer than love”</p></li>
<li><p>Grace comprehended produces love in your heart</p></li>
<li><p>Love produces a desire to please and obey -&gt; not because you have to, but because you want to.</p></li>
<li><p>Here is the difference between law and grace</p></li>
<li><p>Both law and grace teach it is wrong to steal</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Under the law, you are made to do it because you have to</p></li>
<li><p>Under the law of grace, you do it because you want to.</p></li>
<li><p>Example of “No Spitting” sign in train station.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If you do not have a deep desire in your heart to be holy, godly, then probably because of pride, you have not properly perceived God—s grace.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:12</strong> <em>Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>If you love God, more than yourself, you will want to live a godly, pleasing life unto Him.</p></li>
<li><p>So don—t stop sinning because you have to, do it because you want to in response to Christ—s love</p></li>
<li><p>So don—t do what is right because you have to, do it because you want to in response to Christ—s love.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Spirit</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>By grace we are given the Holy Spirit</p></li>
<li><p>Whom enables us to live godly</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>He works in our heart and conscience to convict and lead us into righteousness (John 16)</p></li>
<li><p>He gives us the power to be witnesses</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>This is the Biblical reason to be filled with the Spirit (Act 1:8)</p></li>
<li><p>To be able to live as a witness for him.</p></li>
<li><p>God supplies the power for life.</p></li>
<li><p>Condition is repentance from self-trust and faith in Christ</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Chastening</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>Heb 12:6</strong> <em>For whom the Lord loveth he <u>chasteneth</u>, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Heb 12:10</strong> <em>For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>God—s grace, his favor, works in our life to chasten us to holiness</p></li>
<li><p>Thank God for the trials, the difficulties, etc. -&gt; can be a sign of His favor and grace.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Grace is undeserved favor freely given</p></li>
<li><p>Saving Grace is God—s undeserved favor and blessing of salvatoin freely given through His Son Jesus Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>Ten General Lessons in Saving Grace</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>Salvation is a Gift of Grace</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:11</strong> <em>For the grace of God that <u>bringeth salvation</u> hath appeared to all men,</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:14</strong> <em>Who gave himself for us,ΓÇª.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Wholly of the favor of God</p></li>
<li><p>Grace by definition involves God—s favor</p></li>
<li><p>Whole of salvation, past, present, future is a gift of His grace - His divine undeserved favor</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Saving Grace is Needed by Everyone</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:11</strong> <em>For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared <u>to all men,</u></em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>All need to trust Christ. Religion, etc. do not cut it.</p></li>
<li><p>Needed by the unbelievers -&gt; since we all fall short of God—s perfect standard</p></li>
<li><p>Needed by believers to grow in the faith.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>It is Conditional Upon Faith in Christ</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Conditioned on faith. Must be received by faith. Eph 2:8-9</p></li>
<li><p>Conditioned on receiving the gift of grace by faith</p></li>
<li><p>Paul is not teaching “universal salvation”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>He is not teaching that everyone will be saved</p></li>
<li><p>There are many people today who because they refuse to admit their need of grace and a savior, want to believe that God will eventually save everyone.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>There is a difference between “bringing salvation” and “receiving salvation”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Christ brought the gift of salvation for all men, but you must receive the gift to be saved</p></li>
<li><p>Example of Roosevelt—s Pardon</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The same is true both for unbeliever and to grow as a believer</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Saving Grace is of Great Comfort to the Struggling Sinner</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The fact that God brought salvation to all men should be a great comfort to true believers</p></li>
<li><p>No sin, no depravity, nothing beyond the scope of His grace</p></li>
<li><p>So many people, even Christians, have trouble believe God could forgive their particular perversion or sin: homosexuality, abortion, did this, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>God—s grace brings salvation to all - there is nothing beyond the reach of His grace.</p></li>
<li><p>Struggling believer is assured God—s grace will discipline him to the godliness he desires.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Saving Grace affirms the doctrine of eternal security</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>One will never be acceptable to God outside of Christ</p></li>
<li><p>So many believers begin their walk with the Lord in faith; revert to the flesh</p></li>
<li><p>No one in a million years could ever be righteous enough on their own merits to earn acceptance with God.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We truly have eternal security</p></li>
<li><p>I am saved, I am being saved, I will be saved.</p></li>
<li><p>Salvation of the Spirit is secure.</p></li>
<li><p>People who think that if I sin while a Christian or if I die with unconfessed sin in my life, I will not be saved, have a very dim view of God—s grace (and ultimately too high a view of themselves)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>It means in Christ I am completely accepted</p></li>
<li><p>As a person God will not reject me.</p></li>
<li><p>He always looks at me through Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>He does not accept my sin, my works, etc - He will never leave me, forsake me or reject me.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Saving grace destroys any vestiges of self-righteousness</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Face the face, we have none. We have no righteousness outside of Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>The only righteousness before God I possess is the righteousness of Christ.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Saving Grace destroys attitude that some sins are worse than others</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>That man is adulterer, homosexual, pervert, pornographer, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>God hates all sin. There is no sin that is worse in His eyes.</p></li>
<li><p>There are sins whose consequences are worse in our lives.</p></li>
<li><p>Saving grace teaches that a Holy God hates all sin, but that the blood of Christ covers all sin.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Saving Grace destroys my ability to judge and condemn others</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>No one is righteous apart from Christ</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore none of us can condemn and judge others</p></li>
<li><p>It is not judging others to say “this is wrong”</p></li>
<li><p>The Bible judges sin and what the Bible calls wrong, we can call wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Judging others is guessing their motives, assuming their reasons, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Everytime we think we are better than someone, denied the doctrine of God—s grace in our lives.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Saving Grace Teaches Believers Why we need to be broken</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Many believers who resist being broken - think brokeness is misunderstanding of grace</p></li>
<li><p>Opposite is true - Brokeness is a sign of walking in grace</p></li>
<li><p>Come to the point again and again, where you realize moral bankruptcy and spiritual impotency and come broken to the foot of the cross.</p></li>
<li><p>Unbrokeness is a sign of trusting in self, respectability or dignity of your Christianity, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>God still wants to put his finger on areas in your heart</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Saving Grace teaches us the process whereby we are changed</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>I don—t think there is a difference between the way we are initially born-again and the way we are saved.</p></li>
<li><p>Salvation = GRACE + FAITH Sanctification = GRACE + FAITH</p></li>
<li><p>Repenting of self-trust, recognizing moral bankruptcy in an area, and coming to Christ to receive His free pardon, washing and love in that area.</p></li>
<li><p>Which is why the process of conviction, repentance, faith and grace is still the way to change.</p></li>
<li><p>Some here who feel like they are bound in sin - can not change.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You could not save yourself</p></li>
<li><p>Came and said, I am hopeless, here I am Lord, I believe, save me.</p></li>
<li><p>Change process is the same way.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The hindrances to initial salvation are the hindrances to change and growth</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The don—t believe in their moral bankruptcy</p></li>
<li><p>The deny justice of God -&gt; one day stand before God</p></li>
<li><p>The refuse to admit inability</p></li>
<li><p>In short, refuse to receive God—s free grace.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Cooperation between grace and faith</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Part we play, part God plays</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:12</strong><em>Teaching <u>us</u> that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and go dly, in this present world;</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:14</strong> <em>Who gave himself for us, <u>that he might</u> redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>When we come, he changes our heart, out attitudes, etc.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>It was my hope this morning that you would better understand Saving Grace</p></li>

<p><em>Text:</em> Tit 2:15 Vision: 5-3-0-3-5-0 Type: 0-3-5</p>
<p><em>Keywords:</em> Pastor,</p>
<p><em>Description:</em> Sermon on the pastoral mantle</p>
<ol type="I">
<li><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Scripture Reading: Titus 2:1-15</p></li>
<li><p>Recall that the Lord has had us studying through the book of Titus</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Messages from Titus are like stones in a foundation, being laid one at a time (both individually &amp; corporately)</p></li>
<li><p>Just like a foundation on a house is not pretty, but very necessary, so too our time in Titus.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Take a moment and review the five foundation stones we have looked at so far</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>The Nature of a True Servant of God</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>A true servant of God is a <u>bond-slave</u>, one who is willing to serve to the disregard of his own interests, despite the personal cost &amp; in humble service</p></li>
<li><p>A true servant of God exists for the <u>Benefit of Others</u> (Tit 1:1, Paul was called “<em>for the faith of God—s elect</em>”) - The true servant of God knows they are where they are at to build other and for others and never for one—s self, one—s honor, one—s needs, or one—s ministry, etc. -&gt; for the benefit of others</p></li>
<li><p>A true servant of God knows all that ministry is a <u>sacred trust</u> (<em>which is <u>committed</u> {entrusted-NASB} unto me -</em> Serving God is not a game. Weight, a burden, a responsibility, a trust. No matter how or where you are serving God, people are counting on you, depending on you and trusting you.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>The necessity and priority of godly leadership {individually and corporately}</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Healthy Doctrine (or instruction in the Christian faith)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Called to live a life that adorns or beautifies the gospel that we believe</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Motivation and foundation of the Christian life is the Grace of God</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The word grace means - “an undeserved blessing freely bestowed”</p></li>
<li><p>The “grace of God— speaks of God—s wholly <u>undeserved</u> blessing of salvation freely bestowed upon all who would receive it.</p></li>
<li><p>Grace teaches that we are all morally bankrupt, spiritually impotent, having nothing to offer God</p></li>
<li><p>Only way a person can be saved is by faith in Jesus Christ alone given freely by His grace</p></li>
<li><p>Saving grace destroys any vestiges of self-righteousness - that I am somehow better than others</p></li>
<li><p>Saving Grace destroys attitude that some sins are worse than others</p></li>
<li><p>Saving Grace Teaches Believers Why we need to be broken</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Many believers who resist being broken - think brokeness is misunderstanding of grace</p></li>
<li><p>Opposite is true - Brokeness is a sign of walking in grace</p></li>
<li><p>Come to the point again and again, where you realize moral bankruptcy and spiritual impotency and come broken to the foot of the cross.</p></li>
<li><p>Unbrokeness is a sign of trusting in self, respectability or dignity of your Christianity, etc.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If these five “stones” become part of the foundation of our life individually and corporately, the result will be healthy spiritual growth in the people and the church as a whole</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>To the degree these foundation stones are missing or corrupted in a believer or church, will be the degree a believer or a church is corrupted. {does not matter how long you have known the Lord}</p></li>
<li><p>These things are of the utmost importance</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The next verse or portion of Scripture we come to in our study of Titus is Titus 2:15</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Titus 2:15</strong> <em>These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Titus 2:15</strong> <em>These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you.</em> (NAS)</p></li>
<li><p>This verse also I believe, provides another important foundation stone for us individually and corporately</p></li>
<li><p>Before we look at what this stone is, I think it will be helpful to first answer the question of “why did Paul write this verse”</p></li>
<li><p>We can understand why the Holy Spirit led Paul to pen this verse by looking at the phrase “<em>let no man despise {disregard} thee</em>”</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Why would Paul say that “ΓÇª<em>let no man despise or disregard thee</em>”?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Some think Paul is instructing Titus as their preacher and pastor to earn the people—s respect by holy and blameless living.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Similar to what Paul told Timothy in <strong>1Ti 4:12</strong> <em>“Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.”</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>In other words, Titus, don—t ruin your teaching by improper living or being a poor example.</p></li>
<li><p>You will earn people—s trust and respect by holy and proper living.</p></li>
<li><p>This is true.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>People who walk what they talk earn respect by being good examples.</p></li>
<li><p>Good and true example helps establish and impart authority and respect (in any endeavor or field)</p></li>
<li><p>Hypocrisy does destroy respect.</p></li>
<li><p>Since we are usually blind to our own hypocrisy, I give you liberty to make me aware of any hypocrisy you see in my life. {other than speeding}</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>This is why Paul writes in <strong>1Thes 5:12</strong> <em>ΓÇª to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;<br />
</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You want to take time to know and examine those teaching and speaking the word of God into your life to see if they are worthy of your trust and respect.</p></li>
<li><p>Be very careful following people you don—t know</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>While all of this is absolutely true, I do not believe the context supports this interpretation.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Others think when Paul said, “<em>let no man despise or disregard thee</em>”, that Paul is speaking to the people to esteem and respect Titus as their Pastor and not to despise him by treating him as common and ordinary</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>It is very true throughout Scripture that we are called to hold those God has chosen in very high regard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1Thes 5:13</strong> <em>And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sakeΓÇª.</em>(KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>It is true that no office is to be regarded with greater respect than those who are entrusted with God—s Word and God—s people.</p></li>
<li><p>People called, gifted and entrusted by God with His most precious possessions - His people and Word</p></li>
<li><p>Which is why we “esteem the ministry” - Treat our guest ministry with respect and reverence.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, although this is true, I don—t believe the context supports this and that this is what Paul is saying.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The context of the book of Titus helps explain why Paul writes “<em>let no man despise {disregard} thee</em>”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Review context of Titus</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>People being led astray by teachers teaching unhealthy doctrine</p></li>
<li><p>Christians were majoring in the minors and minoring in the majors</p></li>
<li><p>People calling themselves Christians with no evidence of changed lives [Tit 1:16]</p></li>
<li><p>Character of the Cretans - rebellious, fleshy, carnal [Tit 1:12]</p></li>
<li><p>General crookedness in the churches and the lives of the Christians living in Crete. [Tit 1:5]</p></li>
<li><p>Paul left Titus in Crete to literally “straighten out these problems and issues” [Tit 1:5]</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>You can imagine how some of the people would take to Titus coming in to deal with these issues.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Mr. Unhealthy Teacher -&gt; “O yes, what I have been teaching is wrong”</p></li>
<li><p>Mrs. 20 year believer -&gt; “I know what I have believed for 20 years could not be wrong”</p></li>
<li><p>Mr. Argumentative over Secondary Issues</p></li>
<li><p>Mrs. Rebellious who does not like being told to submit to anyone of anything</p></li>
<li><p>Mr. Crooked -&gt; this is crooked in your life and need to change or be straightened out</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>When Titus began to deal and speak on these issues, not everyone would like it.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong><u>He would not be the most popular preacher on TV</u></strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Would you agree there was a <em><u>possibility</u></em> that some people might “despise” or certainly try to “disregard” Titus message and ministry?</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>From this context, we see four reasons why Cretans would have reason to despise Titus and disregard his ministry and teaching [this helps us understand why Paul under the inspiration of the Spirit, penned verse 15]</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>He had to bring correction to people who were mislead and astray</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The old man does not like correction</p></li>
<li><p>Even as believers, correction can be unpleasant</p></li>
<li><p>Does not like it when God comes in to correct something in our life</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>He had to bring change</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>People generally don—t like change in any area, especially when it comes to themselves</p></li>
<li><p>Not everyone likes hearing the Word of God come and tell them they need to change the way the live, or what they are doing</p></li>
<li><p>People aren—t always eager to hear that the need to stop being so selfish and being to be a better father</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>He was coming teaching things different than what they had been taught</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Titus was not there to feed itching ears, deal with people—s desire for novelty and new doctrines.</p></li>
<li><p>Titus was not there to deal with secondary issues that really did not make a difference in how they lived</p></li>
<li><p>Its hard enough for us to change what we believe</p></li>
<li><p>Nevermind when we need to change what we were first taught in the faith</p></li>
<li><p>Why grounding new believers with the proper truth is SO CRITICAL.</p></li>
<li><p>Makes the difference between a healthy birth and a stunted Christian life</p></li>
<li><p>Just like a child in the natural</p></li>
<li><p>I have seen so many Christians unable to overcome previous unhealthy teaching that they received when they first got saved, they never will be useful to God.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>He was coming with real and true authority</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>We saw this was Paul—s purpose in the introductory verses, to establish Titus authority.</p></li>
<li><p>Authority always conveys authority [you don—t appoint yourself boss]</p></li>
<li><p>Not everyone loves submitting to authority</p></li>
<li><p>Human nature being what it is, sometimes people despise being placed under authority.</p></li>
<li><p>This is an especially true in the church.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In the world, your boss can apply power to the authority given</p></li>
<li><p>The kingdom of God relies on people voluntarily submitting</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>We can clearly see and understand why the people in Crete why the people might despise or disregard Titus ministry and teaching.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Under the unction of the Holy Spirit, Paul wrote this verse to clearly establish what Titus mandate was as God—s messenger in Crete.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Paul made it clear to both Titus and the Cretans (both pastor and people) what God—s mandate to His messenger is</p></li>
<li><p>He made it clear <u>so Titus would fulfill it</u> and <u>so the people would not disregard it</u></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Title: “<em>The Preacher—s Mandate</em>”</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>I simply want us to look at Paul—s mandate to Titus so that we as a church can understand one of the major roles God has given the Pastor/Preacher as God—s messenger to the church.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Three reasons why I think this is important for you to know and understand this mandate</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><u>So you don—t despise or disregard Pastor/Preacher</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Even though this sounds self-serving, it really is not</p></li>
<li><p>So you don—t refuse the ministry that God is seeking to bring into your life.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Cretans disregarded Titus, they would have remained far away from God—s purposes and God—s best for their life</p></li>
<li><p>Your purpose, spiritual prosperity and destiny depend on not despising the Preacher—s mandate</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Understand what to expect</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>One time I made a comment in passing on it being wrong to steal from the government</p></li>
<li><p>Someone who is no longer here came up and took great offense to that.</p></li>
<li><p>Told me my job is to preach love and grace and that as a Pastor, I had no right to say such a thing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Tim 4:2</strong> <em>Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Reprove - means to “use the word like a sword and cut open the sin in a heart that God might remove it”</p></li>
<li><p>Serious difference is expectations.</p></li>
<li><p>The pastor/preacher has a mandate from God as His messenger</p></li>
<li><p>In understanding his mandate, you will know the authority he possesses, the message he should bring and the means by which he should bring it.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Recognize and understand the scope and limitations of Pastoral authority in your life and the life of the church.</u> (this will be clear in a little bit)</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>What is The Preacher—s or Pastor—s Mandate?</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>The preacher or pastor—s mandate is simply this: to authoritatively communicate God—s Word to his people.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:15</strong> <em>These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. ..</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Meaning the things Paul had previously written</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2Tim 4:2</strong> <em>Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>One of the fundamental roles of a pastor is to authoritatively communicate God—s authoritative Word to His people.</p></li>
<li><p>Goal is to strive to bring his hearers to understand, believe and obey God—s Word.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>A large part of the pastoral ministry is communication of God—s Word to God—s people</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Tit 1:3</strong> <em>But hath in due times <u>manifested his word through preaching</u>, ΓÇª</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 1:9</strong> <em>Holding fast the faithful word <u>as he hath been taught,</u> ΓÇª.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:1</strong> <em>But <u>speak</u> thou the things which become sound doctrine:</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:6</strong> <em>Young men likewise <u>exhort</u> to be sober minded.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:8</strong> <em><u>Sound speech</u>, that cannot be condemned; ΓÇª</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:15</strong> <em>These things <u>speak</u>, and <u>exhort</u>, and <u>rebuke</u> with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 3:1</strong> <em><u>Put them in mind</u> to be subject to principalities and powersΓÇª</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 3:8</strong> <em>ΓÇª <u>I will that thou affirm constantly,</u> that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. ΓÇª</em> (KJV)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The Pastor/Preacher is called to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Accurately interpret and proclaim Scripture (with sympathy, compassion and humility - John McCarther)</p></li>
<li><p>2Ti 2:15</p></li>
<li><p>Present and communicate the authoritative truth of God—s Word</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>There are at least two reasons why is it important for us as a people to understand this.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Should expect {no demand} of your Pastor to be in the Word of God</em></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Number one thing you should desire and demand from your Pastor is to be in the Word of God</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acts 6:3-4</strong> <em>Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. 4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>As a congregation, each one of you should do whatever it takes to ensure that I am in the Word and prayer.</p></li>
<li><p>To put it blunt, in a large degree you pay me to <u>study</u> and then <u>communicate</u> the Word of God.</p></li>
<li><p>Some might think, what does a Pastor do. 25-30 hours/week in study and prayer, not that important - and yet to a large degree, it is God—s mandate.</p></li>
<li><p>A preacher—s mandate is to help God—s people understand, apply and obey God—s Word in their life</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>Deals with the experience oriented society we live in</em></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>I love when God moves. I love the presence of God.</p></li>
<li><p>But our faith is not founded on experience, its founded on the word of God.</p></li>
<li><p>Word of God has a high role to play in our corporate life.</p></li>
<li><p>The purpose of praise is to bring our hearts to a point where we can hear what God is saying to us.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>Deals with the age of relativism</em></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>We live in a time when people think that whatever they believe is right and true</p></li>
<li><p>Feels right, so it must be true.</p></li>
<li><p>My mind tells me its right, so it must be true</p></li>
<li><p>“This is what I believe”</p></li>
<li><p>Preacher comes in with the authoritative Word of God</p></li>
<li><p>Can—t pick and choose {obviously you can, but you can—t}</p></li>
<li><p>Full-gospel means more than moving of the HS, it means the things we don—t like (our vegetables)</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>There are three elements in the authoritative communication of the Word<br />
</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>There are three tools in the Pastor—s toolbox to help fulfill this mandate.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There are three parts to fulfilling this mandate, all which are important for you to be aware of.</p></li>
<li><p>Message, Mantle, Means</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Message</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Pastor/Preacher is given a mandate to speak a message “<em>these things speak</em>”</p></li>
<li><p>Also seen in Christ speaking to the churches in Revelation.</p></li>
<li><p>Message is not</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Foolish questions</p></li>
<li><p>Things that engender strife</p></li>
<li><p>Things that don—t promote faith or godliness (1Ti 1:5)</p></li>
<li><p>Not personal tidbits or trifles</p></li>
<li><p>Not things you can—t speak with authority or certainty</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:15</strong> <em>These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with <u>all authority.</u> ΓÇª</em>(KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>The word is to be communicated with authority, which means you had better be sure you are speaking for God</p></li>
<li><p>There are certain things that are clearly understood and can be spoken with authority</p></li>
<li><p>You can—t communicate what you are unsure of with authority (though sometimes preachers try to fake it)</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Paul said speak “<em>these thingsΓÇª”</em> [concludes 2:1] -</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>These are the types of things a preacher and a pastor is to communicate</p></li>
<li><p>These are things you can be sure of. Speak with authority</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>What types of things do we see?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Grace of God</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Brings salvation</p></li>
<li><p>Need to be broken of self</p></li>
<li><p>Motivation for a holy life</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Holy Living [12] - sanctification is the will of God {being conformed to the image of Christ}</p></li>
<li><p>Second Coming</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Don—t speculate about what you don—t know</p></li>
<li><p>Speak about what you do know</p></li>
<li><p>These will probably be the only things I may ever speak about the second coming, because they are the only things you can say from sure</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Matt 24:44</strong> <em>Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.</em> (KJV)</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Christ is coming back</p></li>
<li><p>He is coming back the same way he left</p></li>
<li><p>He could come at any time</p></li>
<li><p>No one knows when</p></li>
<li><p>It will be the most blessed and glorious event ever “the glorious appearing”</p></li>
<li><p>Christ will come again to judge the living and the dead; so you—d better be ready</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2Cor 5:10</strong> <em>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Practical relationships:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>How to love your God</p></li>
<li><p>How to love your spouse,</p></li>
<li><p>How to be a good employer or employee</p></li>
<li><p>How to be a grandparent</p></li>
<li><p>Learn not to slander, gossip, be a busybody, etc.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>How to serve, witness and live the Christian life and be the peculiar people of God we are called to be</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Preacher—s mandate is to communicate God—s Word to His people that helps them walk with Him, serve Him and live in this life - not to tickle ears, feed intellectual fancy -&gt; produce changed and fruitful lives to Christ</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Mantle</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>God gives the Pastor a mantle of authority “<em>with all authority”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Scope of Pastoral Authority is two-fold</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><em>Government of the church</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Tit 1:5</strong> <em>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Overseer—s (or Elder—s) which includes the Pastor is given the authority to rule and regulate the practical affairs of the church.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>Communication of the Word of God</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Pastor has God-given authority to speak and communicate the Word of God</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:15</strong> <em>These things speak, ΓÇª with all authority. ΓÇª</em>(KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Authority -&gt; command -&gt; speaks of forceful and absolute communication.</p></li>
<li><p>Can confidently declare with full authority, right from wrong</p></li>
<li><p>Can confidently say that “fornication is sin” or that homosexuality is wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Where the Word of God is clear, the communicator of the Word can confidently state so with all authority.</p></li>
<li><p>When a preacher speaks the properly interpreted and true Word of God, He is speaking with the very authority of God.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>This is important because it helps us understand the scope and limitations of pastoral authority</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Pastoral authority is limited and directed to these two areas: affairs of the church and communicating the word of God</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>In terms of governing or directing affairs of the people, it is limited to the corporate church.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>A pastor can—t govern or direct your affairs on the job or in the home.</p></li>
<li><p>Can tell people what to do, set goals, standards, etc. with respect to the affairs in the church, but not elsewhere.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1Pe 5:2-3</strong> <em>Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, ΓÇª3 Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>It is important to understand that a Pastor can never tell you what to do - in the area of decision making</p></li>
<li><p>Example if you are trying to decide should I take this job</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Realize, I will never tell you what to do</p></li>
<li><p>I—ll try to help you see how you might apply the Word of God to your decision, but I can—t tell you want to do, because I am not given authority</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>I can—t tell you what to do with your children or in this area, all I can do is help communicate what God—s Word says in that area.</p></li>
<li><p>This is important because we like to be told what to do - its easier</p></li>
<li><p>Need to realize, its evil and its manipulation.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>A pastor—s authority does extend to the Word of God.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>A pastor can authoritatively state certain things are right and wrong, if the Bible clearly does so.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Bible is silent or unclear, so too must the Pastor be.</p></li>
<li><p>While a Pastor can never tell you what to do - in the area of decision making, he can direct you with authority in areas that the Word of God addresses.</p></li>
<li><p>I had the authority from the Word of God to tell that person that stealing from the government is wrong because the Word of God says so.</p></li>
<li><p>This is often a problem in our post-Christian society today</p></li>
<li><p>“Many churchgoers simply do not want to hear authoritative and demanding preaching about an authoritative and demanding God. Like those whom Paul warned Timothy, they are not inclined to “endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears ticked, they accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires (2Ti 4:3). In our day, there is no shortage of preachers who are willing to oblige such self-centered hearers. By and large, the most popular preaching is broad-minded, anecdotal, entertaining, ego-building, and above all, never confrontational or dogmatic. It offends no pride disturbs no conscience and is a clear reflection of the humanistic spirit of the age, in which tolerance and unity at any cost are the supreme virtues. It is essential to preach the Word with authority in order to counteract the prideful rejection of God—s truth and authority that is the root of all sin. Satan rebelled against God in heaven and later lured man into rebelling against God on earth. Consequently fallen man has no regard for God—s law, God—s will, God—s holiness or God—s sovereignty. And when God and His Word are rejected, it is inevitable that spiritual and moral absolutes are rejected. All believes and standards become relative and optional, a matter of personal choice. Only an authoritative Word from God that is heard, believed and obeyed can rescue sinners from their rebellion” - John McCarther</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Simple point: The word that is communicated is authoritative</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Means</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Pastor/preacher is given a three-fold <em>means</em> to communicate the word of God</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><u>Speak</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Preacher—s mandate is to clearly communicate the Word of God</p></li>
<li><p>Must take the time to clearly make the word of God understood to all</p></li>
<li><p>If I am not doing this, please see me after, let me know, question me, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>If you think what I said is wrong, please question me.</p></li>
<li><p>I used to question my pastor about everything. (wait patiently at end of service)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Exhort</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Encourage people to embrace and practice what is being taught</p></li>
<li><p>Urge people to obey</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking to the whole man: intellectual, emotional, spiritual to get people to embrace and live out God—s truth</p></li>
<li><p>My purpose is preaching: “<em>to persuade people to faith in the word of God</em>”</p></li>
<li><p>To engage, move and deposit you at the feet of Christ where you will find all that you need</p></li>
<li><p>I know the greatest blessing for your life is to be fully persuaded in the Word of God</p></li>
<li><p>I believe with all my heart its in your best interest to fully embrace the message of God—s</p></li>
<li><p>Embracing the message is called faith.</p></li>
<li><p>I am pleading for you to obey God—s Word by faith</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Knowing double-mindedness will hurt you</p></li>
<li><p>Cold hearts will affect you</p></li>
<li><p>Knowing unwillingness to be broken of self-strength by God—s grace will hinder fullness of God in your life.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Exhortation is preaching to convict</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Preacher can—t be afraid to say things that will make people mad</p></li>
<li><p>Its my job to say things that will make you mad</p></li>
<li><p>Afflict the comfortable</p></li>
<li><p>You make me feel terrible -&gt; that—s my job -&gt; now go to Christ and find forgiveness and cleansing</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Rebuke (reprove)</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Reprimand, correct, reprove</p></li>
<li><p>Try to get people that are willfully going their own way to repent and go God—s way</p></li>
<li><p>I want to make three comments on Pastoral Correction</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Here—s where people have a problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Don—t think a pastor has any right to correct them</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Pastoral Correction</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><em>A pastor has God-given authority to bring correction to the local congregation via the Word of God.</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>That is what Titus was sent to do. “<em>Rebuke with all authority</em>”</p></li>
<li><p>There are times that has to be done. (2Ti 4:2)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>Scope of Correction</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Brings general corporate correction that the Lord may bring to the body from time to time.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Might add, only the Pastor or Overseers have the authority to bring correction to the congregation.</p></li>
<li><p>Part of the “Governmental ministry” in the church</p></li>
<li><p>Your ability to correct someone in the church as an individual is limited to two areas:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Individual offenses</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>Matt 18:15</strong> <em>Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If you have been given charge over a certain ministry -&gt; correct in love those serve under you</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If the entire body needs correction, whether it be in giving or serving, etc. only be received from the Pastor.</p></li>
<li><p>By the way you do have the ability to correct me - two situations</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>If I as person offend you -&gt; come to me according to Mt 18:15</p></li>
<li><p>If in my duties as the Overseer, need to take two or three can come to me.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Private correction with respect to the affairs of the church</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The Pastor has authority from God to speak the word into a life and bring correction.</p></li>
<li><p>E.g. “worship team”</p></li>
<li><p>Functioning in a ministry -&gt; going own way or outside certain boundaries.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Church discipline {which fortunately is rarely needed in its full process}</p></li>
<li><p>In the context of our relationship I may become aware of something that needs correction</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>I will try to bring the Word of God to bear on the situation</p></li>
<li><p>A pastor has that authority from the Word of God</p></li>
<li><p>Not speaking about the struggling sinner</p></li>
<li><p>Dee sleeping with a married man (Pastor went to her privately)</p></li>
<li><p>Chronic gossip hurting people in the church by sticking nose in everyone—s business</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>Pastoral Correction (or any correction) is not harsh</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>2Ti 2:25</strong> <em>In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gal 6:1</strong> <em>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>It is to be gentle but sharp.</p></li>
<li><p>The Word of God is what is to cut.</p></li>
<li><p>Pastoral correction is done in love with the purpose being restoration and repentance.</p></li>
<li><p>I vow to not correct an individual publicly (except in accordance with Mt 18)</p></li>
<li><p>You might think I am singling you about some thing in your life, but I make a very conscious effort not to do that.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Just from the fact that the Pastor is called to bring correction into people—s lives should help us understand why people might disregard or despise him.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Disregard what he has to say and keep on doing own thing</p></li>
<li><p>Not allow him the liberty to speak correction</p></li>
<li><p>As your Pastor, do you despise me? Do I have a liberty to speak a corrective word into your life?</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong><br />
Conclusion</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>The preacher or Pastor—s mandate: Communicate God—s Authoritative Word to His people”</p></li>
<li><p>The preached word of God is a foundational both individually and corporately</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In-dwelt word that sets men free</p></li>
<li><p>Releases the power of God into the lives of God—s people</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>1 Cor 1:18</strong> <em>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Paul knew that if Titus fulfilled his mandate, things would get straightened out in Crete.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If you don—t despise the preacher—s mandate, things will be straightened out in your life as well.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Close with personal example</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I am a product of the preached Word of God</p></li>
<li><p>My whole life is changed.</p></li>
<li><p>I was thinking, 15 years ago I set out not knowing where I was going, only map was the word of God.</p></li>
<li><p>Most miserable, angry, anxious person -&gt; in a great degree because the preached Word of God.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If the pastoral mandate is to authoritatively communicate the word of God to the people.</p></li>
<li><p>Do you despise it?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Pick and choose what you want to believe</p></li>
<li><p>Clinging to initial beliefs that God might be trying to get you to change?</p></li>
<li><p>Refusing to be corrected - its of the Lord</p></li>
<li><p>Refusing to allow change</p></li>
<li><p>Refusing to examine initial beliefs</p></li>

<li><p>Refusing to allow the Word to move you?</p></li>

<p><em>Title:</em> The Nature of Sound Doctrine</p>
<p><em>Date:</em> 08/28/99 2:17 PM Revision: 2/17/2026 2:31:00 PM</p>
<p><em>Text:</em> Tit 1:10-Tit 2:12 Vision: 0-4-0-4-2-1-5 Type: 0-3-0-5</p>
<p><em>Keywords:</em> Titus, Doctrine</p>
<p><em>Description:</em> Sermon on the importance and nature of sound doctrine.</p>
<ol type="I">
<li><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Scripture Reading: Titus 1:1-2:15</p></li>
<li><p>Opening Comments</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The last few weeks the Lord has had us in the book of Titus</p></li>
<li><p>The messages that have come forth are not what I would call “soul-shaking” messages; and yet for us as a young church, I believe are foundational of all that God is doing in us individually and corporately</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>We read last time in Titus 1:5 how Paul left Titus on the island of Crete to “<em>set in order the things that are wanting (or lacking</em>)”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Greek word ΓÇÿ<em>set in order</em>” was a term used in ancient times to describe the setting of a broken bone or the straightening out of bent limbs- it speaks of straightening out things that are crooked or not right</p></li>
<li><p>Paul left Titus in Crete to literally “straighten them out”</p></li>
<li><p>Straighten out and correct a number of problems in the Cretan churches.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Things were not right, they were crooked and broken.</p></li>
<li><p>Grace was license, teachers in the church were off-center from the main focus unto “non-issues”</p></li>
<li><p>The stuff the teachers were teaching was “unhealthy”</p></li>
<li><p>People were not living right. Grace was being abused. [2:12]</p></li>
<li><p>Both the doctrines and practices in the church were defective [1:14]</p></li>
<li><p>Division. Churches were failing [1;5], hypocrisy [1:16]</p></li>
<li><p>People had come to Christ, but their lives were not changing.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Paul left Titus in Crete with instructions to straighten these things out and get the churches healthy.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Two things Paul told Titus to do to straighten things out <em>{set things in order}</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>Establish Godly leadership</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>Tit 1:5</strong> “<em>Ordain elders in every city</em>” - (because there was probably a church in every city.)</p></li>
<li><p>We looked last time how the first thing that needs to needs to happen to produce a strong and healthy church is to establish godly leadership - not a move of the Holy Ghost, not evangelism program, etc. but to raise up godly leaders.</p></li>
<li><p>We saw how raising and establishing godly leadership was Paul—s pattern and priority in the church</p></li>
<li><p>We also looked at the character qualifications that define true Christian maturity and qualify people for leadership in the local church.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Teach Sound Doctrine</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:1</strong> <em><u>But</u> speak <u>thou</u> the things which become sound doctrine:</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>In contrast to the existing teachers in the church who were teaching unhealthy doctrine and leading people astray -&gt; Paul told Titus to teach sound, healthy doctrine.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Title: “<em>The Nature of Sound Doctrine</em>”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Two things I want to look at:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Importance of Sound Doctrine</p></li>
<li><p>Identify Sound Doctrine - General characteristics of sound doctrine</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Purpose of this message is to equip you to be able to identify healthy and unhealthy doctrine and teaching in the Christian faith.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>We need to know what healthy doctrine looks like, so we can reject unhealthy instruction.</p></li>
<li><p>The main purpose of this morning—s message is to provide you with some general instruction as to what healthy doctrine looks like in order that you might reject and avoid unhealthy doctrine.</p></li>
<li><p>This may not sound like an life-shattering emotional message, but it is very important to your life, health and destinies in Christ.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>The Importance of Sound Doctrine</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>There was a Peanuts cartoon with Lucy and Linus looking out the window at a steady downpouring of rain. “Boy”, said Lucy, “look at it rain. What if it floods the whole world?” “It will never do that,” Linus replied confidently. “In Genesis 9, God promised that it would never happen again”. “You—ve taken a great load off my mind”, said Lucy with a relieved smile. Linus pontificated, “Sound theology has a way of doing that”.</p></li>
<li><p>Sound and healthy doctrine is important and it does impact people—s lives.</p></li>
<li><p>Before we look at some reasons why doctrine is important, let me give you some real life examples of people I have met over the years {not in this congregation}</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Husband-&gt;“Head of Household”-&gt;”Cave Man” -&gt;Dictator to wife and servant-&gt;family was greatly affected</p></li>
<li><p>New Believer-&gt;Not taught assurance of salvation-&gt;spend whole walk in legalism and insecurity</p></li>
<li><p>Man who shot the Jewish center-&gt;Phinehas Priesthood (Num 25) -&gt; lives were affected</p></li>
<li><p>Told sit, stand, kneel, bow for 45 min/week and God is satisfied -&gt; people with Christless eternity</p></li>
<li><p>Woman who saw demon for everything -&gt; yet divorced three times. Children reject the faith.</p></li>
<li><p>Another man I know one time who was taught to believe He could claim his way out of poverty-&gt; when nothing happened after ten years, he walked away from God and His family -&gt; his instruction was not healthy nor sound.</p></li>
<li><p>“In Jesus name” -&gt; 20 years waiting for this prayer and nearly walked away when it did not come to pass.</p></li>
<li><p>People want to harshly condemn homosexuals and fornicators, without seeing that God puts greed and filthy language in the same list [Eph 5]</p></li>
<li><p>I could go on and on and on, but I hope these help to illustrate the importance of sound or healthy doctrine.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Eight reasons why sound doctrine - healthy instruction in the Christian faith is necessary and important</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>The Christian life is not natural</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>We don—t naturally know how to live the Christian life, anymore than a newborn naturally will grow up right</p></li>
<li><p>The Christian life is not natural to the man of flesh - 1Cor 2:14</p></li>
<li><p>When Paul told Titus to “<em>speak</em> <em>sound doctrine</em>” he was telling him to provide “healthy, wholesome, sound instruction and teaching in the Christian faith”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The word “<em>doctrine</em> “ simply means ΓÇÿinstruction or teaching”</p></li>
<li><p>Used to refer to teaching and instruction about God, Christ, salvation, faith, living for Christ, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>“<em>Sound</em> “ - ΓÇÿhealthy, safe, whole, that which promotes growth—</p></li>
<li><p>Paul is telling Titus to set things in order by instructing people with teaching in the Christian that promotes health, growth, life and fullness.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Everyone of us needs doctrine - healthy instruction in the Christian faith - certainly not born with a knowledge of how to live the Christian faith.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>When you are born-again, we don—t naturally know what God wants, what pleases God, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>They only way we can know is by being instructed in His Word.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prov 14:12</strong> <em>There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.</em></p></li>
<li><p>What seems right to us, only leads to spiritual death.</p></li>
<li><p>We need instruction i.e. doctrine in the Word.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2Ti 3:16</strong> <em>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrineΓÇª:</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>The Scriptures are the only source for all instruction in the faith</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Show me any believer who despises sound teaching from the Word of God in favor of experience, feelings or personal desires - I—ll show you a believer who falls short of God—s best for their life</p></li>
<li><p>Failure to learn healthy doctrine can very much be likened to leaving a child to raise themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>There were no true mature teachers in Crete; hence serious trouble in the church and the people—s lives.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>The Presence of Teachers who Teach Unhealthy Doctrine</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Repeatedly throughout the NT, Paul, Jesus, etc. warn of false and unhealthy teachers coming in</p></li>
<li><p>People being used by Satan to lead God—s people astray</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Tim 4:1</strong> <em>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed ΓÇªdoctrines of devils;</em> (KJV) -&gt; teaching people to not eat meat, get married, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>We know this to be true, not only from Titus 1, but also from personal experience, not everyone who claims to teach the Word of God for Christ is in fact teaching the true and pure Word of God</p></li>
<li><p>Many of us who were raised in a church were surprised to find what we were taught did not line up with the Word of God. -&gt; taught “commandments of men” [14]</p></li>
<li><p>Which is why we are all called to be students of the word 1Tim 2:15 - check out what is being taught</p></li>
<li><p>Two things we need to realize about unhealthy instruction in the faith</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>It is disguised</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Its not presented in an outright lie i.e. Jesus is not Savior</p></li>
<li><p>We would reject that</p></li>
<li><p>Its mixed with some truth to make it plausible. Adam/Eve. Jesus in garden, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>God will provide all your needs turns into God will make you rich</p></li>
<li><p>We are rich in Christ -&gt; rich in grace, forgiveness, love, etc.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Not always false, but just not healthy</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Like food. Nothing wrong with a yodel occasionally</p></li>
<li><p>Try to live on them -&gt; you have problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Nothing wrong with some of these far out teachings [occasionally]</p></li>
<li><p>You will perish if you try to live on them [prophecy, eschatology, spiritual warfare, etc.]</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Necessary for Right Relationship and Worship of God<br />
</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Salvation - John 14:6 - You can not be saved apart from truth and sound doctrine</p></li>
<li><p>If the Jesus you confess is not God and born of a virgin -&gt; not saved-&gt; don—t have an eternal spotless sacrifice for sins.</p></li>
<li><p>Necessary for True Worship - John 4:24</p></li>
<li><p>God is not obligated to accept any worship we give to Him</p></li>
<li><p>God of truth.</p></li>
<li><p>You can not live in lies and expect the God of truth to be with you</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Titus 1:16</strong> <em>They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work <u>reprobate</u>.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Reprobate = not approved by God or rejected by God</p></li>
<li><p>Not in an eternal salvation sense, but rejected as being what God wants</p></li>
<li><p>Baking God apple pies only to find out He hates apple pie</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Sound doctrine is necessary to set people free<br />
</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>John 8:32</strong> <em>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Healthy doctrine sets people free from sin.</p></li>
<li><p>Sets people free to love their spouse, be themselves, forgive hurts, be loosed from things that bind them, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Healthy doctrine is truth. <strong>John 17:17</strong> <em>Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>One of the ways you know healthy and sound doctrine is being proclaimed is by the fruit [Mat 7]</p></li>
<li><p>In Titus, fruit of the doctrine was not changed lives.</p></li>
<li><p>Sound doctrine produces the fruits of a Christlike character, but also changed lives.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u><br />
Sound Doctrine is Necessary to be an effective witness for Christ</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The world does not want the Christ the church offers, because the witness has been corrupt</p></li>
<li><p>One of the points that Paul was making in Titus</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:10</strong><em>ΓÇª that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>The portrait the public church in USA has presented is not attractive:</p></li>
<li><p>Greed, harshness, issue-oriented, rules and useless regulations, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Randy—s men devotion story about Christian at work who does not work - people don—t want that.</p></li>
<li><p>Another example: if you don—t know salvation is a work of God, you will try to beat, cajole, etc. people to Christ when the Lord said, “flesh and blood did not reveal thisΓÇª”</p></li>
<li><p>Unhealthy doctrine has portrayed Christianity as a set of rules instead of a relationship with God that manifests itself in Rom 14:17</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Doctrine affects the direction of our life</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>In verse 14, Paul reveals that one of the results of unhealthy doctrine is turning people from the truth</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 1:14</strong> <em>Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Christians who have sold everything and moved to the mountains because of Y2K</p></li>
<li><p>“Turned from the truth” -&gt; taken out of the game.</p></li>
<li><p>The enemy will do whatever he can to get you off the highway of holiness</p></li>
<li><p>Remember the Korean Airlines Flight 007 that strayed into Soviet airspace. Caused by of 1 degree error at the point of departure.</p></li>
<li><p>Small error in course may not be obvious for a while, but in time it brings more harm.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>The quality of your doctrine and instruction affects your usefulness for God</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>How messed up children are when they get poor instruction.</p></li>
<li><p>Children raised as racists think its OK to hate.</p></li>
<li><p>Same is true in the kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p>How many of God—s people because of unhealthy doctrine and instruction in he Christian life are ruined and are unable to be used by God.</p></li>
<li><p>Find them in extremes. One issue. e.g. KJV Only man. Conspiracy theories.</p></li>
<li><p>Why Paul in giving the qualifications for leaders speaks of being sober - balanced judgment, not given to extremes, not one issue, blown with every wind of fad doctrine in the KOG.</p></li>
<li><p>There is truth that I will die for: Jesus is the Christ. There is truth that I won—t fight for.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Sound Faith depends on Sound Doctrine</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Sound faith depends on sound instruction.</p></li>
<li><p>The quality of the Christian life depends on the quality of the instruction.</p></li>
<li><p>What you are taught affects how you live</p></li>
<li><p>Example: your children</p></li>
<li><p>Same here in Titus - that was Paul—s whole point.</p></li>
<li><p>Unhealthy teaching produces unhealthy Christians</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Sit under teachers who teach you to be greedy -&gt; be greedy</p></li>
<li><p>Sit under lots of prophecy teaching and everything that happens is somehow related to the end times -&gt; that will the quality of your faith.</p></li>
<li><p>Sit under teaching that likes to argue doctrine -&gt;produce argumentative Christians</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The quality of your faith depends on the quality of the instruction/doctrine.</p></li>
<li><p>Its for this reason that God that those who teach His Word will experience a much harsher judgment, because lives and destinies are affected.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>So for all these reasons, healthy instruction in the Christian faith is not only necessary but very important</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Whether your instruction comes from your daily Bible reading or from myself or a tape, TV, book, another church, etc. it is very important that it be healthy and sound instruction.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to equip to you recognize the difference between unhealthy and healthy instruction, regardless of the source, I want to give you some <em>general</em> characteristics of healthy doctrine and sound Christian teaching.</p></li>
<li><p>Help you recognize healthy and unhealthy teaching, whether it be in this place or wherever.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Identifying Sound Doctrine - Five Characteristics of Sound or Healthy Doctrine (Instruction)</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p><u>Pure</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Leads to holy living. Leads to godly living.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:11-12</strong> <em>For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, 12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>James 3:17</strong> “<em>The wisdom from above is first pureΓÇª”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Grace received purifies</p></li>
<li><p>Sound doctrine promotes inward purity of heart vs. outward observances</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 1:14</strong> <em>ΓÇª commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Hearkens back to Jesus words in Mark 7 {men worship me with lips but hearts are far from me}</p></li>
<li><p>Jesus hates religion - he wants your heart</p></li>
<li><p>Healthy doctrine promotes inward purity and sincerity</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Promotes</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Sound and Healthy doctrine is seen in what it promotes.</p></li>
<li><p>Tit 2:11-14 teaches that the purpose of grace is not only to save people from their sins, but to purify a people holy unto God - that is able to love Him and love each other in our service.</p></li>
<li><p>Healthy teaching has a mark - it promotes certain things.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1Tim 1:5</strong> <em>Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Sound doctrine aims and promotes at the mark: Love of God, Love of each other, Genuine Faith, living right</p></li>
<li><p>Brings us closer to God, makes us more Christlike.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Three Core Areas where Sound Doctrine Manifests Itself</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><u>Sound in Faith</u> <strong>Tit 2:2</strong> <em>That the aged men be ΓÇª sound in faith, ΓÇª.</em> (KJV)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Sound doctrine makes people sound in faith.</p></li>
<li><p>Sound doctrine teaches God can be trusted. He is wise in every way.</p></li>
<li><p>He is good. Just and right is He. He is perfect in all His ways.</p></li>
<li><p>Older men, because they have walked with God, should manifest this fact.</p></li>
<li><p>Learned God can be trusted in every way</p></li>
<li><p>They have learned not to question God—s wisdom, Word or ways</p></li>
<li><p>Confident in full obedience to God—s ways regardless of the cost.</p></li>
<li><p>Sound doctrine teaches us to ignore feelings, what we see, and walk totally and completely in accordance with the Word of God</p></li>
<li><p>Faith is being persuaded that God is who He has declared Himself to be in His Word.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Sound in Love</u> <strong>Tit 2:2</strong> <em>ΓÇª sound in ΓÇª charity, ΓÇª</em>(KJV)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Sound doctrine makes people sound or healthy in love.</p></li>
<li><p>Healthy and genuine love of God, each other and the lost</p></li>
<li><p>Great commandments are the foundation of your life.</p></li>
<li><p>Sound doctrine in love teaches:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>To love when not deserved</p></li>
<li><p>To love when rejected</p></li>
<li><p>To love like 1Cor 13</p></li>
<li><p>To love like Christ - sacrificially and unselfishly</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Sound in Patience</u> <strong>Tit 2:2</strong> <em>ΓÇª sound in ΓÇªin patience.</em> (KJV)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Sound doctrine teaches endurance</p></li>
<li><p>Greek Word “<em>humpone</em>” - <u>cheerful endurance in trials and tribulations</u></p></li>
<li><p>Thayer—s: “the characteristic of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>James 1:3</strong> <em>Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Accept disappointment, endure hardship, they have learned to live graciously with difficulties.</p></li>
<li><p>They know how to live when things do not turn out the way they like.</p></li>
<li><p>They know Rom 8:28</p></li>
<li><p>Its “Little Miss Much Afraid—s” “acceptance with joy”</p></li>
<li><p>Any doctrine that teaches there is no suffering, hardship or difficulties in this life is contrary to the NT</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Act 14:22</strong><em>ΓÇª exhorting them ΓÇª that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Pet 1:7</strong> <em>That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ</em>:</p></li>
<li><p>Sound and healthy doctrine equips God—s people to be “more than conquerors through Christ”</p></li>
<li><p>Sound doctrine teaches that nothing is able to separate us from the love of God in Christ and that He is working and able to redeem even the worst situation to His glory and our eternal good.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Practice<br />
</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Healthy doctrine manifests itself in practice. Outworked in your life.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Seen in your life. Not just some intellectual exercise</p></li>
<li><p>Healthy doctrine results in a changed life.</p></li>
<li><p>People see it.</p></li>
<li><p>Healthy doctrine is does not result in some intellectual beliefs, doctrine is instruction in the Christian faith and it is designed to make a difference in your life.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Jewish religionists in Titus had made it just intellectual beliefs</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>Tit 1:16</strong> <em>They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>They professed to believe things, but no evidence of their beliefs in practice.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>People believe and argue over the 16 different ways Christ could come back; yet they live like He is never coming back.</p></li>
<li><p>Intellectual Christianity is a real trap in today—s intellectual, knowledge driven society.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>2Ti 3:7</strong> <em>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Doctrine is not so much what you believe with your mind, but rather what you live with your feet</p></li>
<li><p>If what you are learning is not affecting how you live, not washing, changing, purifying -&gt; indication something is wrong</p></li>
<li><p><strong>James 2:18</strong> <em>Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Peaceable</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In general, sound doctrine does not engender strife among believers.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>(Unbelievers will react and reject concept of sin and absolutes)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gal 5:23</strong> <em>ΓÇª against such there is no law.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Teaching people not to slander, gossip, love wife, etc. -&gt; no controversy, no issue</p></li>
<li><p>Its just right.</p></li>
<li><p>No one is going to argue if the Scripture says “love your wife”</p></li>
<li><p>No one is going to argue when it tells the older woman -&gt; love good, be positive, avoid negative, bitter mouth.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Unhealthy doctrine in Crete was causing division and dissension - Jewish fables</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>2Ti 2:23</strong> <em>But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>How much of Christian teaching genders strife, controversy, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe Christ is to be the stumbling stone</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>People turn to controversies and intellectual arguments because it helps them avoid the more painful issues within their own heart. “Fig-leave religion”</p></li>
<li><p>Sound doctrine promotes peace with our brethren and pain in OUR flesh.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Practical</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Sound and healthy doctrine is practical. It affects people where they live.</p></li>
<li><p>Look at the affects of sound doctrine in Titus 2: Job, Home, Desires, Behavior, Attitudes, Duties, Relationships</p></li>
<li><p>Healthy and sound doctrine is very practical. It makes a difference in your life.</p></li>
<li><p>I got up the other morning, the dishwasher needed to be emptied, it did not matter how Christ was coming back -&gt; dishwasher still needed to be emptied by a husband called to serve his wife.</p></li>
<li><p>To that struggling believer whose soul needs strength, it really does not matter if they pray sitting, standing, kneeling, -&gt; all that really matters is the soul meets the living God.</p></li>
<li><p>Sound and healthy doctrine is practical. Makes a difference how you live.</p></li>
<li><p>To the Cretans, part of the doctrine and instruction was not practical.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Some scholars thing that the “Jewish fables” in Tit 1:14 refers to Biblical numerology</p></li>
<li><p>See the same thing today, books and teachings on Bible Codes.</p></li>
<li><p>I don—t know if it is true or not. I just know it is totally unimportant</p></li>
<li><p>Mark Twain: “Its not the things I don—t know that bother me, but the things I do know”</p></li>
<li><p>Healthy Doctrine is practical.</p></li>
<li><p>Rom 14:17</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>We don—t have time this morning to look at all of the specifics of what Paul told Titus to teach as sound doctrine, but in the few minutes I have left, lets just look at a few of these things that are not only practical, but also promote a faith that is growing, healthy, safe and whole.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Healthy Doctrine teaches people how to be good employees and deal at work (Sound Doctrine at Work)</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><u>Submissive</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:9</strong> <em>Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, ΓÇª; not answering again;</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Obedient [submissive] - hupotasso</p></li>
<li><p>Willingly submit yourself to all that is required of you, regardless of how unreasonable</p></li>
<li><p>Leave if intolerable or immoral</p></li>
<li><p>A Christian worker who first of all is concerned about his personal rights dishonors God</p></li>
<li><p>Not to be argumentative</p></li>
<li><p>Follows instructions of supervisors, does not talk back or contradict or back stab his boss.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Spirit of Excellence</u> <strong>Tit 2:9</strong> <em>Exhort servantsΓÇª to please them well in all things; ΓÇª;</em> (KJV)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>To be well-pleasing</p></li>
<li><p>Go beyond the call of duty</p></li>
<li><p>Excellent attitude, work ethic, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Be early, be superior. Work hard.</p></li>
<li><p>How to do a better job, improve the company, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Christians are to be the best employees and the hardest workers.</p></li>
<li><p>Reason you do this is because you do it as “unto the Lord” -&gt; you are “in the ministry”</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Does not Steal</u> <strong>Tit 2:10</strong> <em>Not purloining,ΓÇª</em> (KJV)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Not stealing time, money, things, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>This is best seen by what happens when no one is looking or watching.</p></li>
<li><p>God is watching.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Faithful</u> <strong>Tit 2:10</strong> <em>ΓÇª but shewing all good fidelity; ΓÇª</em>(KJV)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Be faithful, loyal, trustworthy, dependable, on-time, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Don—t misuse sick days.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Another area is in the area of our words and speech</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:3</strong> <em>The aged women likewise, that they be ΓÇª not false accusersΓÇª</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>“False accusers” - same word translated “devil”</p></li>
<li><p>Slanders. Not malicious gossips.</p></li>
<li><p>Teach people that it is wrong and sin to speak evil, criticize, gossip, slander.</p></li>
<li><p>Woman watch what you say about people, about their children, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Always worry about “did you see that, etc.”</p></li>
<li><p>If you can—t be positive, put a zipper on it.</p></li>
<li><p>He told Titus the same thing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:7-8</strong> <em>In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in ΓÇª, 8 Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; ΓÇª</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Whole, healthy, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Conversation, not negative, impure, etc. etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Sound doctrine teaches people to edify and build people with speech vs. have their mouth be a sewer.</p></li>
<li><p>Sound doctrine teaches that a mature Christian does not have diarrhea of the mouth</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Sound Doctrine teaches us to be Sensible</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Sound Christian doctrine teaches people to live sensible</p></li>
<li><p>Same related Greek word is used in: temperate [2], sober [4], discreet [5], sober-minded[6]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:6</strong> <em>Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>NAS: Be sensible</p></li>
<li><p>Word means to “have common sense, good judgment and self-control”</p></li>
<li><p>Some would say, for that to happen in a man, would have to be the Lord</p></li>
<li><p>Sound Christian instruction teaches men to avoid their impulses</p></li>
<li><p>Need to bridle your passions because you can spend a life-time paying for impulse.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a fruit of the Spirit</p></li>
<li><p>To show how practical this is, imagine how different our life would be if we truly learned to be sensible from an early age -&gt; I—d have a lot more money in the back and a lot less egg on my face.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Spouses to love one another</u></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>We have a number of older women here. You had better not get in the way of your children—s marriages.</p></li>
<li><p>You are called to turn them and teach them to love their spouses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tit 2:4</strong> <em>That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</em> (KJV)</p></li>
<li><p>Same is true with the children.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>And so in conclusion, I truly hope you were able to understand the importance of sound doctrine</p></li>
<li><p>I hope were able to grasp the nature of sound and healthy doctrine: Pure, peaceable, promotes faith, love, endurance, practiced, practical</p></li>
<li><p>If some of you that are younger in the faith grasp these elements of Christian instruction, keep you, but also lead to prosperous, useful and joyful life in Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>Its my hope that some of you who are older in the faith might understand why things maybe did not turn out in your walk or calling like you had hoped. Unhealthy doctrine some how has “turned you” God—s best course for your life. Its not too late to being to reject unhealthy and unsound doctrine and embrace true instruction in the faith.</p></li>
<li><p>There is actually one other mark of healthy doctrine that I should mention in closing - Message of Grace.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Tit 2:11-15</p></li>
<li><p>These verses give the theological basis for the previous section, that is, they give the reason why Titus should teach Christians to display exemplary behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>“For” - It is as if Paul was saying "The reason why you should teach Christians to behave this way is because..,"</p></li>
<li><p>This theological basis is about God's grace that has been revealed for the purpose of bringing salvation for all humankind. Saved by grace. Eph 2:8-9</p></li>
<li><p>Enabled by grace.</p></li>
<li><p>True grace enables Christians to live lives that are acceptable to God as they wait for the return of Jesus</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>True grace enables Christians to truly enter into close relationship with the living God through His son.</p></li>
