<h1 id="chapter-insights-obadiah">Chapter Insights ΓÇô Obadiah</h1> <ul> <li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)"> <p>Obadiah challenges me to look at what makes me feel secure and where I am finding my security. Is it my bank account? My job? My gifting? My position? The chapter exposes how easily these things can take the place of trusting the Lord.</p> </div></li> <li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)"> <p>Pride is deceptive. It blinds us to our true state. We think we are fine and cannot even see that there is a problem. Obadiah shows how pride reassures us even as it leads us toward collapse.</p> </div></li> <li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)"> <p>I am responsible not only for what I do, but for how I respond when I see injustice and the suffering of others. Obadiah confronts a comfort mentality that wants to stay detached and uninvolved.</p> </div></li> <li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)"> <p>Taking satisfaction, even inwardly, in the misfortune of others is wicked. Obadiah exposes how gloating can exist quietly in the heart without ever being spoken out loud.</p> </div></li> <li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)"> <p>The flesh does not win in the end. What is driven by self-protection, pride, and advantage may appear strong for a time, but it does not last. What belongs to the Lord endures. The kingdom will be His.</p> </div></li> <li><div data-custom-style="Normal (Web)"> <p>The pattern: Pride lifts the heart toward false security. That pride produces deception. Deception blinds the heart. Holiness restores proper alignment under GodΓÇÖs rule.</p> </div></li> </ul>
