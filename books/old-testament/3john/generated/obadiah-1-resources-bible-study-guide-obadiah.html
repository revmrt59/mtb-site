<p>Title: Bible Study Guide to Obadiah</p>

<ol type="I">
<li><p><strong>Introduction<br />
</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Tonight we are here to study the book of Obadiah</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Shortest book in the Old Testament, consisting of only one chapter and 21 verses.</p></li>
<li><p>Obadiah is considered one of "<em>The Minor Prophets</em>"</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>A collection of twelve books that make up the last part of the Old Testament</p></li>
<li><p>Augustine is credited with being the first to classify them in this way</p></li>
<li><p>The distinction pertains only to the length of the books</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The "major prophets" include the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel</p></li>
<li><p>The "minor prophets" are those twelve books from Hosea to Malachi</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Reading: Obadiah: 1:1-21</p></li>
<li><p>When ever you go to study anything in the Bible, it is important to understand the context.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Context is KING</p></li>
<li><p>In order to understand the context and all that was going on, it is helpful to try and determine the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Author – who wrote it? What were they going through? What was in their mind?</p></li>
<li><p>Date – when did they write it? Helps shed light on any historical circumstances, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Place: Where did they write it from?</p></li>
<li><p>Background: What was going on?</p></li>
<li><p>Occasion: What was the purpose for writing it, in light of the background events</p></li>
<li><p>Audience: To whom was it written?</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Introduction to the Book of Obadiah</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p><strong>Author: Obadiah<br />
</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Obad</strong> <em>The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord GOD concerning Edom — We have heard a report from the LORD, And an envoy has been sent among the nations saying, "Arise and let us go against her for battle" —</em> NASB</p></li>
<li><p>His name means "Servant of the Lord” (“servant of Yahweh”)</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Obadiah was a very common name in the OT</p></li>
<li><p>At least 12 people in the Bible with this name</p></li>
<li><p>One Jewish tradition identifies him as the one who was Ahab's steward</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Who hid 100 prophets from Jezebel, Ahab's wife - 1 Kin 18:3-4</p></li>
<li><p>Who feared the Lord from his youth - 1 Kin 18:12</p></li>
<li><p>The timing does not fit</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>We really don’t know who Obadiah was</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We know very little about him – nothing else in Scripture</p></li>
<li><p>In fact, we do not even know if this was his real name - or he was just referring to himself as “the servant of the Lord”</p></li>
<li><p>We know very little about his background, tribe, family, profession, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>He is just “servant of the Lord”</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>What a lesson for us right off the bat</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>It is not about us</p></li>
<li><p>It is not about the messenger, but about the message</p></li>
<li><p>We are just “bondslaves”</p></li>
<li><p>John the Baptist</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Are you the Christ”</p></li>
<li><p>'There is One coming after me whose latches of His shoe I am not worthy to loose. I baptize you with water but He will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire'. Listen to what he said, 'I must decrease and He must increase'.</p></li>
<li><p>You see that's the voice of the prophet of God.</p></li>
<li><p>Any prophet of God that talks about 'me, my and mine and everything that I have done and all the achievements that I have had in my life' is not the true messenger of God, because he is taken up more with the messenger than the message.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The heart of a true servant of the Lord is seen in not making it about you.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Date<br />
</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Since the Bible gives no facts about either Obadiah or his life, there is some debate about when he wrote it.</p></li>
<li><p>Normally it is important to know when something was written, since it helps us understand context as we know what is going on and why God led him to write it.</p></li>
<li><p>The internal clues make it clear that it was written shortly after an invasion of Jerusalem</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>Obad 11</strong> <em>"On the day that you stood aloof, On the day that strangers carried off his wealth, And foreigners entered his gate And cast lots for Jerusalem — You too were as one of them.</em> NASB</p></li>
<li><p>We read about Jerusalem being invaded</p></li>
<li><p>Normally that makes us immediately think of the Babylonian invasion</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>That is one of the two dates scholars suggest for the date of writing</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>586 BC: Destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians where Jerusalem was destroyed and the people carried into captivity</p></li>
<li><p>845 B.C.: The days of Jehoram (848-844 B.C.), when Philistines and Arabians attacked the city<br />
- 2 Chr 21:8-10,16-17</p></li>
<li><p>It is also possible it was written prophetically before the fall of Jerusalem (12-14) as the prophet sees the fall and then speaks about what Edom will do</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>I am not going to go into the reasons for each – scholars go either way</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>I don’t think it makes too much difference because scholars suggest two dates for when the book was written and in either case involve an attack or invasion on Jerusalem</p></li>
<li><p>I tend to take the view that it was written at the destruction of Jerusalem</p></li>
<li><p>My comments will reflect that</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Place Of Writing<br />
</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Nothing of known of where it was written from</p></li>
<li><p>Obadiah could be in Jerusalem</p></li>
<li><p>Or he could be somewhere in captivity</p></li>
<li><p>The text seems to indicate he saw or experienced the destruction going on</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes events stir us to seek God and get a Word from Him</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Background<br />
</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>By reading the book, we can get the picture a bit about what is taking place</p></li>
<li><p>In one part of the picture, we have the Jews being killed and slaughtered an exiled by an invading army</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Jerusalem has been invaded. The walls have been broken down. The city is ablaze. Soldiers are pillaging and plundering the city.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the citizens are being killed</p></li>
<li><p>Some are being taken captive (fugitives being taken into captivity</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Obad 14</strong> <em>"And do not stand at the fork of the road To cut down their fugitives; And do not imprison their survivors In the day of their distress.</em> NASB</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The other part of the picture is about a people called “the Edomites” standing and watching what is happening</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><em><strong>Obad 1</strong> The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord GOD concerning Edom — …</em> NAS<em>B</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Obad 11</strong> <em>"On the day that you stood aloof,On the day that strangers carried off his wealth, And foreigners entered his gate And cast lots for Jerusalem — You too were as one of them.</em> NASB</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Obad 12</strong> <em>"Do not gloat over your brother's day, The day of his misfortune. And do not rejoice over the sons of Judah In the day of their destruction; Yes, do not boast In the day of their distress.</em> NASB</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Obad 14</strong> <em>"And do not stand at the fork of the road To cut down their fugitives; And do not imprison their survivors In the day of their distress.</em> NASB</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Get the picture?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The Jews and Jerusalem are being destroyed by an invading army while Edom stands and watches</p></li>
<li><p>They gloat over what is happening</p></li>
<li><p>They are killing the fugitives and not letting them find refuge in their country.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The picture gets even worse than this if we understand who the “Edomites” are?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The Bible makes it clear that the Edomites were the descendents of Esau</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Genesis 36:8</strong> <em>So Esau lived in the hill country of Seir; Esau is Edom.</em> NASB</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gen 36:19</strong> <em>These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom ), and these are their chiefs.</em> NASB</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Meanings</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Esau (unknown, though some think it means ‘hairy’)</p></li>
<li><p>Edom = red</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>Genesis 25:25</strong> <em>Now the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment; and they named him Esau.</em> NASB</p></li>
<li><p>Description of Esau’s physical appearance</p></li>
<li><p>Interestingly Jacob was named according to his character</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The people of Edom descended from Esau, Jacob's twin brother</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There was sibling rivalry between Edom and Israel, found first in Esau and Jacob</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The twins struggled in their mother's womb - Gen 25:22-26</p></li>
<li><p>Esau sold his birthright to Jacob - Gen 25:27-34</p></li>
<li><p>Jacob stole Esau's blessing as the firstborn - Gen 27</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>While Jacob and Esau eventually reconciled (Gen 32-33), their descendants were often at odds with one another</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Edom is also known in the Bible as Seir, Hor and Esau</p></li>
<li><p>Territory</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Bordered Judah to the east and south</p></li>
<li><p>Extended southward from the border of Moab to the Gulf of Aqaba</p></li>
<li><p>On the eastern side Edom was bordered by desert and was ~20-30 miles wide and about ~100 miles long.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Importance of Edom (James Boice)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Situated along great trade routes between Syria and Egypt</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Trade brought business and wealth</p></li>
<li><p>Got wealthy from tolls extracted from many caravans</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Edom’s natural strength and security</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The central area is characterized by red sandstone cliffs that rise to more than 5,000 ft above sea level.</p></li>
<li><p>The made their homes in the cliffs</p></li>
<li><p>Made them feel relatively secure</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The point is that it was their brothers who were rejoicing in their downfall and watching them be destroyed.</p></li>

We shall not pass through field or through vineyard; we shall not even drink water from a well. We shall go along the king's highway, not turning to the right or left, until we pass through your territory.' " 18 Edom, however, said to him, "You shall not pass through us, lest I come out with the sword against you." 19 Again, the sons of Israel said to him, "We shall go up by the highway, and if I and my livestock do drink any of your water, then I will pay its price. Let me only pass through on my feet, nothing else." 20 But he said, "You shall not pass through." And Edom came out against him with a heavy force, and with a strong hand. 21 Thus Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his territory; so Israel turned away from him.</em> NASB</p></li>

<li><p>THE COMING JUDGMENT ON EDOM (1-9)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The decree has gone forth to the nations (1)</p></li>
<li><p>Deceived by pride in her location, Edom will be brought down (2-4)</p></li>
<li><p>Destruction will be complete (5-6)</p></li>
<li><p>Edom will be betrayed by allies (7)</p></li>
<li><p>Not even wisdom and might can save them (8-9)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>THE REASON FOR JUDGMENT ON EDOM (10-16)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>For violence and unbrotherly conduct toward Jacob (10-11)</p></li>
<li><p>A rebuke against such conduct (12-14)</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore the "Day of the Lord" for them will mean receiving the same sort of treatment! (15-16)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>THE EXALTATION OF ISRAEL OVER EDOM (17-21)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Deliverance and holiness will be found on Mt. Zion, not Mt. Seir (the prominent mountain in Edom)! (17a)</p></li>
<li><p>The house of Jacob shall consume the house of Esau (17b-18)</p></li>
<li><p>The children of Israel will possess Edom and surrounding nations (19-20)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Obad 1</strong> <em>The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord GOD concerning Edom — We have heard a report from the LORD, And an envoy has been sent among the nations saying, "Arise and let us go against her for battle" —</em> NASB<em><br />
</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>The vision of Obadiah.</em></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Here Obadiah claims to have a vision</p></li>
<li><p>Because prophets considered themselves ‘seers’</p></li>
<li><p>Indicative of that the communication may not have just been words</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>Thus says the Lord GOD concerning Edom</em></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>He gets right into it – nothing about himself</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I have a message from the Lord</p></li>
<li><p>This says the Lord</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Peter 1:21</strong> <em>for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.</em> NASB<em><br />
</em></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>He is speaking to Israel about Edom</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The basic message is that God is going to judge Edom</p></li>
<li><p>This is the central theme: the judgment of Edom – flesh brothers</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>— We have heard a report from the LORD, And an envoy has been sent among the nations saying, "Arise and let us go against her for battle"</em></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><em>We</em> – Obadiah and the Jewish people</p></li>
<li><p><em>have heard a report from the LORD<br />
</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>God is revealing what is going to happen in the spirit realm</p></li>
<li><p>God is revealing what He is doing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Amos 3:7</strong> <em>Surely the Lord GOD does nothing Unless He reveals His secret counsel To His servants the prophets.</em> NASB</p></li>

<ol type="a">
<li><p><em>This is the prophecy of Obadiah — what the Sovereign LORD said about the nation of Edom. The LORD Will Punish Edom The LORD has sent his messenger to the nations, and we have heard his message: "Get ready! Let us go to war against Edom!"</em> TEV</p></li>
<li><p><em>In a vision the Lord God showed Obadiah the future of the land of Edom. "A report has come from the Lord," he said, "that God has sent an ambassador to the nations with this message: 'Attention! You are to send your armies against Edom and destroy her!'"</em> TLB</p></li>
<li><p><em>This is the vision that the Sovereign LORD revealed to Obadiah concerning the land of Edom. Edom's Judgment Announced We have heard a message from the LORD that an ambassador was sent to the nations to say, "Get ready, everyone! Let's assemble our armies and attack Edom!"</em> NLT</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>God is sending a messenger to stir up the nations, telling them to unite in war to destroy the Edom</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>This points out a central truth seen through the Scriptures</p></li>
<li><p>God is over the nations</p></li>
<li><p>He exalts one and brings down another</p></li>
<li><p>Psa 2</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ps 113:4</strong> <em>The LORD is high above all nations ; His glory is above the heavens.</em> NASB</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Obad 2</strong> <em>"Behold, I will make you small among the nations; You are greatly despised.</em> NASB<em><br />
</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Here is what the Lord is saying to Edom</p></li>
<li><p><em>Behold -</em> Look what I am going to do (take note)</p></li>
<li><p><em>I will make you small among the nations<br />
</em></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Other translations</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The LORD says to Edom, "I will make you weak; everyone will despise you. TEV</p></li>
<li><p>"I will cut you down to size among the nations, Edom, making you small and despised. TLB</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>You are greatly despised<br />
</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>God speaking their future</p></li>
<li><p>They will be greatly despised</p></li>
<li><p>He is speaking about humbling them so that other nations despise them</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Remember Edom prided herself in her great wealth by trading, and by her geography which seemed to protect her - Reminds me of America</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>God is saying that in contrast with their self-exalting spirit, He would make them small and in contrast with their pride, He would bring them down.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>James 4:6</strong> <em>But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, "God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble."</em> NASB</p></li>

</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Obad 3</strong> <em>"The arrogance of your heart has deceived you, You who live in the clefts of the rock, In the loftiness of your dwelling place, Who say in your heart, 'Who will bring me down to earth?'</em> NASB</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>The arrogance (or pride) of your heart has deceived you</em></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>What a verse and a lesson</p></li>
<li><p>Edom is deceived</p></li>
<li><p>Deceived in thinking they are protected</p></li>
<li><p>Deceived in thinking nothing can touch them</p></li>
<li><p>Deceived in thinking that their rocks and geography will keep them from being protected and destroyed</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The next part of the verse contains the deception they were thinking</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><em>You who live in the clefts of the rock, In the loftiness of your dwelling place, Who say in your heart, 'Who will bring me down to earth?'</em></p></li>
<li><p>Living in a high, rocky place, caused them to think no one could bring them down.</p></li>
<li><p>They were deceived into thinking where there strength came from and their protection came from</p></li>
<li><p>Anytime we think it is from ourselves, we are deceived.</p></li>
<li><p>“Contributing to this self deception was the supposed security of Edom’s geographical location in the mountains of Seir.” – Bible Knowledge Commentary pg. 1456</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Matthew Henry: What Edom says in the pride of his heart: Who shall bring me down to the ground? He speaks with a confidence of his own strength, and a contempt of God's judgments, as if almighty power itself could not overpower him</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Obad 4</strong> <em>"Though you build high like the eagle, Though you set your nest among the stars, From there I will bring you down," declares the LORD.</em> NASB</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>An eagle builds his nest in high rocks and places nearly inaccessible to man</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Edom was building in high rocks and places that seemed inaccessible</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>Though you set your nest among the stars, From there I will bring you down," declares the LORD.</em> NASB<em><br />
</em></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Even if you were to build in the height of heaven, it won’t make a difference.</p></li>
<li><p>God has determined to judge Edom and all of your defenses are equally useless</p></li>
<li><p>All of man’s defenses are useless against the judgments and decrees of the Most High God</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>This whole passage kind of reminds me of the “I will’s of Satan”</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>Isa 14:12-17</strong> <em>How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! 13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: 14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. 15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. 16 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; 17 That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?</em> KJV</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Obad 5</strong> <em>"If thieves came to you, If robbers by night- O how you will be ruined! — Would they not steal only until they had enough? If grape gatherers came to you, Would they not leave some gleanings?</em> NASB</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Here God begins to speak about the utter ruin that will come upon them</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>If thieves came by night, they would leave something behind</p></li>
<li><p>When the grapes are gleaned, there are gleanings left</p></li>
<li><p>Implied is the destruction that God was going to bring was total</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike either the thieves or grape gatherers, the Lord is going to leave nothing behind</p></li>
<li><p>Edom will be completely wiped out</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Think about this in our modern view of God who judges no sin, tolerates all evil for ever</p></li>
<li><p>Thieves would be more merciful to you than you were to Israel (the chosen brother)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Obad 6</strong> <em>"O how Esau will be ransacked, And his hidden treasures searched out!</em> NASB</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Note the prophet reminds them of their heritage as Esau</p></li>
<li><p>The nation of Esau will be ransacked and she will be stripped of her wealth</p></li>
<li><p>The treasures she thought were hidden and secure will be searched and taken</p></li>
<li><p>The hostile soldiers that God is raising up from other nations will come in and search and find the hidden treasure</p></li>
<li><p>We can’t hide from God – try as we might</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ps 139:7-12</strong> <em>Where can I go from Thy Spirit? Or where can I flee from Thy presence? 8 If I ascend to heaven, Thou art there; If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, Thou art there. 9 If I take the wings of the dawn, If I dwell in the remotest part of the sea, 10 Even there Thy hand will lead me, And Thy right hand will lay hold of me. 11 If I say, "Surely the darkness will overwhelm me, And the light around me will be night," 12 Even the darkness is not dark to Thee, And the night is as bright as the day. Darkness and light are alike to Thee.</em> NASB<em><br />

<li><p><strong>Obad 7</strong> <em>"All the men allied with you Will send you forth to the border, And the men at peace with you Will deceive you and overpower you. They who eat your bread Will set an ambush for you. (There is no understanding in him.)</em> NASB</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Edom prided herself in her alliances and allies but God is declaring these allies will turn on them</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><em>"All the men allied with you Will send you forth to the border,</em></p>

</ol></li>
<li><p>NLT: "<em>All your allies will turn against you. They will help to chase you from your land. They will promise you peace, while plotting your destruction. Your trusted friends will set traps for you, and you won't even know about it</em>.”</p></li>

<li><p>Him – the nation of Edom</p></li>
<li><p>They think they are smart and wise and prudent; yet God says there is no understanding</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prov 9:10</strong> <em>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding .</em> KJV</p></li>
<li><p>Clarke: “Private counsels and public plans are all in operation against thee; and yet thou art so foolish and infatuated as not to discern thy own danger”</p></li>

<li><p>God does not just do things without cause</p></li>

</strong></p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p><u>The faithfulness of the Word of God<br />
</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>God prophesied Edom would be destroyed?</p></li>
<li><p>After the prophecy of Obadiah...</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The Edomites were overcome by the Nabataeans, forced to settle south of Judah</p></li>
<li><p>Around 100 B.C., they were conquered by John Hyrcanus of the Maccabees</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Who forced many of them to be circumcised and accept the Law</p></li>
<li><p>As such, many became nominal Jewish proselytes (Herod the Great was one)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>By 100 A.D., Edom as a race and nation had become lost to history</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>The need to be “spiritual Obadiah’s<br />
</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>His name means "Servant of the Lord” (“servant of Yahweh”)</p></li>
<li><p>We know little about who Obadiah was</p></li>
<li><p>It was not about Him</p></li>
<li><p>I am just a “servant of the Lord”</p></li>
<li><p>sin against a brother</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Stems from pride</p></li>
<li><p>Standing aloof when our brother stumbles - attitude not our brother’s keeper</p></li>
<li><p>Looking down on him (12)</p></li>
<li><p>Gloat</p></li>
<li><p>Feel good about self</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Importance of Being a People of Hope<br />
</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Even in the judgment of Jerusalem, God set a door of hope</p></li>
<li><p>All the prophetic warnings to God’s people give hope</p></li>
<li><p>Even though the prophet saw ruin, He also saw restoration and spoke of it for the comfort and hope of the people</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>You reap what you sow<br />
</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Galatians 6:7</strong> <em>Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.</em> NASB</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Obad 15</strong><em>…As you have done, it will be done to you. …</em>NASB</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Matt 7:2</strong> <em>"For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure , it will be measured to you.</em> NASB</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Luke 6:38</strong> <em>"Give, and it will be given to you; good measure , pressed down, shaken together, running over, they will pour into your lap. For by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return."</em> NASB<em><br />
</em></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Pride goes before destruction<br />
</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 16:18</strong> <em>Pride goes before destruction, And a haughty spirit before stumbling.</em> NASB</p></li>
<li><p>Pride leads to vanity and a sense of independence from God</p></li>
<li><p>Just as Edom took pride in their geographical location, allies, wisdom and might, our pride can make us independent</p></li>
<li><p>Such arrogance God will punish</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isaiah 13:9-11</strong> <em>Behold, the day of the LORD is coming, Cruel, with fury and burning anger, To make the land a desolation; And He will exterminate its sinners from it. 10 For the stars of heaven and their constellations Will not flash forth their light; The sun will be dark when it rises, And the moon will not shed its light. 11 Thus I will punish the world for its evil, And the wicked for their iniquity; I will also put an end to the arrogance of the proud, And abase the haughtiness of the ruthless.</em> NASB</p></li>
<li><p>Pride is deceptive. It blinds.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>The things men trust are will not avail in the day of wrath<br />
</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Money</p></li>
<li><p>Self-protection</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prov 10:2</strong> <em>Ill-gotten gains do not profit, But righteousness delivers from death .</em> NASB<em><br />
</em></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>There is no where to hide or run from God<br />
</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We might think we can hide or protect ourselves from the Lord</p></li>
<li><p>It is impossible</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>The importance of not gloating or rejoicing when your enemy falls<br />
</u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 24:17-18</strong> <em>Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, And do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles; 18 Lest the LORD see it and be displeased, And He turn away His anger from him.</em> NASB</p></li>
<li><p>It shows there is a heart problem - Edom still carried a grudge from when Jacob stole the blessing</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>In the Exodus, Edom refused Israel passage through their land<br />
<br />
<strong>Numbers 20:14-21</strong> <em>From Kadesh Moses then sent messengers to the king of Edom: "Thus your brother Israel has said, 'You know all the hardship that has befallen us; 15 that our fathers went down to Egypt, and we stayed in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians treated us and our fathers badly. 16 'But when we cried out to the LORD, He heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us out from Egypt; now behold, we are at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory. 17 'Please let us pass through your land. We shall not pass through field or through vineyard; we shall not even drink water from a well. We shall go along the king's highway, not turning to the right or left, until we pass through your territory.' " 18 Edom, however, said to him, "You shall not pass through us, lest I come out with the sword against you." 19 Again, the sons of Israel said to him, "We shall go up by the highway, and if I and my livestock do drink any of your water, then I will pay its price. Let me only pass through on my feet, nothing else." 20 But he said, "You shall not pass through." And Edom came out against him with a heavy force, and with a strong hand. 21 Thus Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his territory; so Israel turned away from him.</em> NASB</p></li>

<li><p>They are two opposing forces within the whole of the word of God.</p></li>

<li><p>Esau the man of flesh, loved the flesh</p></li>

<li><p>Flesh rejoices over destruction of spirit</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Esau was a man of the earth, wasn't he? Isn't that what it says? He was a man of the earth, he was a farmer, whereas Jacob was a man that stayed at home. And Adam means an earthly man, Esau was of the earth, profane, proud, filthy,</p></li>
<li><p>One day the flesh is going to be defeated, and the world, the flesh, and the devil by the hand of the Lord Jesus Christ. He's already done it for the believer at the cross, but our old nature still raises its head from day to day, but - hallelujah! - there's a day coming when it will be put to the grave for good and there'll be no resurrection for it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Isaiah 63:3-6</strong> <em>"I have trodden the wine trough alone, And from the peoples there was no man with Me. I also trod them in My anger, And trampled them in My wrath; And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments, And I stained all My raiment. 4 "For the day of vengeance was in My heart, And My year of redemption has come. 5 "And I looked, and there was no one to help, And I was astonished and there was no one to uphold; So My own arm brought salvation to Me; And My wrath upheld Me. 6 "And I trod down the peoples in My anger, And made them drunk in My wrath, And I poured out their lifeblood on the earth."</em> NASB<em><br />
