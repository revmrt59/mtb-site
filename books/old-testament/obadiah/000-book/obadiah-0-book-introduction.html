<h1 id="about-the-book-of-obadiah">About the Book of Obadiah</h1>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Obadiah is the shortest book in the Old Testament, yet it addresses serious matters. It speaks into a moment of loss, injustice, and betrayal and reveals how the Lord responds when pride and cruelty shape human behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>This book is not focused on recounting history for its own sake. It shows how God views actions and responses, especially when people are suffering. Obadiah makes clear that indifference, gloating, and exploitation are not overlooked by the Lord.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>The message of Obadiah presses beyond what people do to how they respond. Standing at a distance, benefiting from another’s fall, or remaining silent in the face of harm carries moral weight before God.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="about-obadiah-the-prophet">About Obadiah the Prophet</h2>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>The name Obadiah means “Servant of the LORD.” Beyond this, Scripture tells us almost nothing about the prophet himself. We are given no background, no lineage, and no personal story that would draw attention to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>This lack of information keeps the focus where it belongs. The authority of the book rests not in the prophet himself, but in the word the Lord speaks through him. Obadiah does not present himself. He delivers the message he has received.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p><span class="emphasis">Shepherd’s Pause:</span><br />
<span class="strong">It is not about the messenger, but about the message.</span> True prophets and servants of God step back so that God’s voice can be heard clearly. As John the Baptist said of Jesus, “He must increase, but I must decrease.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="about-obadiahs-message">About Obadiah’s Message</h2>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Obadiah was written following the destruction of Jerusalem, most likely after 586 BC. The city had been invaded, its defenses broken, and its people killed or carried away into captivity.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>During this time, Edom did not assist Judah. Instead, they stood aside, watched the destruction, rejoiced over it, and took advantage of the situation. They participated in plundering the city and blocked escape routes, handing survivors over to the enemy. They rejoice and gloat in Israel’s misfortune.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Edom’s actions are especially significant because they were not strangers. The Edomites were descendants of Esau, Israel’s brother. This family relationship shapes how Edom is addressed throughout Scripture and explains the severity of the charge against them.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>Obadiah is a prophetic word announcing the judgment of Edom for pride, violence, and betrayal against Judah, while simultaneously assuring God’s people that justice, restoration, and ultimate rule belong to the Lord. Though it is the shortest book in the Old Testament, it addresses enduring themes of pride, brotherhood, divine justice, and the certainty of God’s kingdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="normal-web">
<p>A fuller discussion of Edom’s identity and role in Scripture can be found in the “Deeper Dive- Who Is Edom?”</p>
</div>
<h2 id="purpose-of-the-book">Purpose of the Book</h2>
<p>Obadiah was written to announce the Lord’s judgment on Edom for pride, violence, and betrayal. At the same time, it was written to assure God’s people that injustice does not escape His notice, nor will it prevail forever.</p>
<p>The book also looks beyond immediate events. It points to restoration, deliverance, and the certainty that the Lord’s kingdom will stand.</p>
