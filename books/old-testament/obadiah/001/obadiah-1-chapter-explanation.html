<div class="MTB-Read">
<p>The Elder, To the beloved (G0027) Gaius, whom I love in truth: (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This letter opens in a very personal way.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>John starts by calling himself <span data-custom-style="Strong">“</span><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">the elder.”</span> He is not trying to impress anyone with a title. He is writing as a spiritual father, someone with maturity, authority, and care for God—s people. This already tells us the letter is relational, not formal or distant.</p>

<h3 id="the-judgment-of-edom-announced-19">1. The Judgment of Edom Announced (1—9)</h3>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p>Obadiah 1:1<br />
The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord GOD concerning Edom (We have heard a report from the LORD, And a messenger has been sent among the nations, saying, “Arise, and let us rise up against her for battle” (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>In this verse, we—re told that Obadiah receives a <span data-custom-style="Subtle Emphasis">vision</span>. A vision means God is showing the prophet something directly so that the prophet can speak what God has decided to do. Obadiah is not reflecting on events or offering his opinion; he is receiving a message that originates with God.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The phrase <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"><strong>“</strong></span><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">Thus says the Lord GOD</span><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">”</span> tells the reader how to hear everything that follows. This is not a warning or advice from a human voice. It is presented as God Himself speaking with authority.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The vision is <span data-custom-style="Subtle Emphasis"></span><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight"><em>concerning Edom</em>,</span> which identifies the focus of the message. God is addressing a real nation and holding that nation accountable for what is about to be described.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Within the vision, Obadiah says they have heard <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">a report from the LORD,</span> and that <span data-custom-style="Subtle Emphasis">a messenger</span> has gone out among the nations calling them to rise for battle against Edom. This shows that what God reveals is not only a statement of intent. God is already setting events in motion beyond Edom itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This verse establishes the foundation for the entire book. It tells the reader that the message comes from God, that it concerns Edom, and that what is being revealed is already moving toward action.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Dwell">
<p>Psalm 2 shows the nations raging and plotting, yet doing so under the sovereign rule of God. Psalm 113 declares that “the LORD is high above all nations.” Zechariah likewise presents God at work among the nations, directing events beyond human awareness.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="verses-24-pride-and-false-security-exposed">Verses 2—4 — Pride and False Security Exposed</h3>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p>Obadiah 1:2<br />
“Behold, I will make you small among the nations; You shall be greatly despised.” (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This verse states the outcome plainly. God tells Edom what He is about to do to them. To be made <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">small among the nations</span> means their strength, influence, and standing will be reduced. A nation that saw itself as secure and important will lose its place.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The word <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">behold</span> signals that this is something Edom did not expect. God is announcing a reversal. How Edom sees itself and how it will be seen are about to come apart.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This verse does not explain why this is happening yet. It simply declares what God has decided.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p>Obadiah 1:3<br />
“The pride (H1347) of your heart (H3820) has deceived (H5377) you, You who dwell in the clefts of the rock, Whose habitation is high; You who say in your heart, ΓÇÿWho will bring me down to the ground?—” (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Here God explains why the reversal in verse 2 is coming. Edom—s problem is pride. Their inner confidence has misled them.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>That pride is tied to where they live. Edom—s cities were built in rocky, elevated places that were difficult to reach. Living high up made them feel protected and untouchable.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This confidence shows up in what they say to themselves. They assume no one can bring them down. The verse is showing that their sense of security is not based on truth, but on self-deception.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Dwell">
<p>Pride is deceptive. It blinds us to our true state. We think we are fine and cannot even see that there is a problem. Obadiah shows how pride reassures us even as it leads us toward collapse.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p>Obadiah 1:4<br />
“Though you ascend as high as the eagle, And though you set your nest among the stars, From there I will bring you down,” says the LORD. (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This verse answers Edom—s inner question from verse 3. Even if they rise as high as possible, it will not save them.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The images are meant to be clear and extreme. An eagle flies beyond reach. A nest among the stars means imagined safety at the highest level. God is saying that no height, defense, or advantage places Edom beyond His reach. <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">All of man—s defenses are useless against the judgments and decrees of the Most High God</span></p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The final line matters. This is not an enemy speaking or a threat from another nation. God Himself says He will bring them down. The verse closes the thought by showing that Edom—s confidence fails because it ignores who God is.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Dwell">
<p>This exposes a recurring biblical truth: <span data-custom-style="Strong">pride blinds people to reality</span><strong>.</strong> What seems secure apart from God is always fragile. No height is too high, no defense too strong, no position too protected for the Lord to overturn.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="verses-56-total-exposure-and-loss">Verses 5—6 — Total Exposure and Loss</h3>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Obadiah 1:5</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">If thieves had come to you, If robbers by night—</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">Oh, how you will be cut off!—</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">Would they not have stolen till they had enough?</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">If grape-gatherers had come to you,</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">Would they not have left some gleanings?</span> (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>In this verse, the Lord uses two familiar images to make a point about <span data-custom-style="Strong">how complete</span> Edom—s judgment will be. Thieves steal what they want and then stop. Grape-gatherers harvest a vineyard but always leave something behind. In normal loss, something remains.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>But these images are not describing Edom—s situation; they are setting it apart. The verse is saying Edom—s judgment will not follow ordinary patterns. It will not be partial or restrained.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The cry, <span data-custom-style="Subtle Emphasis">“</span><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight"><em>Oh, how you will be cut off!”</em>,</span> breaks into the images to make that clear. Edom will not be left with remnants or leftovers. What usually remains after loss will not remain here.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This verse prepares the reader to understand that what is coming for Edom is total. The next verse will explain that nothing hidden will escape, but this verse establishes the expectation first: Edom—s loss will be complete.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Obadiah 1:6</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">Oh, how Esau shall be searched out! How his hidden treasures shall be sought after!</span> (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This verse states plainly what verse 5 prepared the reader to expect. Edom—s loss will be complete because everything will be exposed. To be <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">searched out</span> means nothing will be overlooked or passed by.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The name <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight"><em>Esau</em></span> is used to speak to the nation at its root. God is addressing Edom directly and personally, not in vague or distant terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The phrase <span data-custom-style="Subtle Emphasis">“</span><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">hidden treasures</span><span data-custom-style="Strong"><em>”</em></span> refers to wealth and valuables stored away for safety. In the ancient world, people hid important possessions in places they believed were secure and out of reach. God is saying that even those carefully protected resources will be found.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This verse completes the thought begun in verse 5. Not only will nothing be left behind, but even what Edom believed was hidden and secure will be uncovered and taken.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="verses-79-betrayal-wisdom-and-strength-removed">Verses 7—9 — Betrayal, Wisdom, and Strength Removed</h3>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Obadiah 1:7</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">All the men in your confederacy Shall force you to the border;</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">The men at peace with you Shall deceive you and prevail against you.</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">Those who eat your bread Shall lay a trap for you.</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">No one is aware of it.</span> (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This verse explains how Edom—s collapse will begin. It starts with <em><strong>“</strong><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">the men in your confederacy</span></em><span data-custom-style="Subtle Emphasis">,”</span> meaning Edom—s allies, the people they depended on for support. Instead of helping, these allies will <em><strong>“</strong></em><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">force you to the border,”</span> which means they will drive Edom out of its own land and leave them exposed and unprotected.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The verse then moves closer in trust. <span data-custom-style="Subtle Emphasis">“</span><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight"><em>The men at peace with you</em></span><span data-custom-style="Subtle Emphasis">”</span> refers to people Edom believed were friendly and safe. These are not open enemies, yet they will <em><strong>“</strong></em><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">deceive you and prevail against you.”</span> Edom will be overcome through betrayal rather than open attack.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The language tightens again with <em><strong>“</strong></em><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">those who eat your bread.”</span> Sharing a meal in the ancient world was a sign of loyalty and relationship. The verse is saying that even close companions will <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“lay a trap for you</span><em><strong>,”</strong></em> turning trust into danger.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The final line, <em><strong>“</strong></em><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">No one is aware of it</span><em><strong>,”</strong></em> shows why this will succeed. Edom will not recognize what is happening until it is already underway. Their confidence in these relationships will leave them unguarded.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This verse shows that Edom—s downfall will begin internally. What they trusted for safety — allies, peace agreements, and close relationships — will become the means of their undoing.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Obadiah 1:8</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">“Will I not in that day,” says the LORD,</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">“Even destroy the wise men from Edom,</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">And understanding from the mountains of Esau?”</span> (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This verse explains <span data-custom-style="Strong">why</span> the betrayal in the previous verse will succeed. God says He will remove wisdom and understanding from Edom at the very moment they need it most.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Edom was known for counsel and insight. Wisdom was something they trusted in, just as much as their alliances. God is saying that this strength will fail them. They will not be able to see clearly, judge rightly, or respond wisely to what is happening around them.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The phrase <span data-custom-style="Subtle Emphasis">“</span><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">in that day</span><span data-custom-style="Subtle Emphasis">”</span> ties this loss of wisdom directly to the collapse already described. This is not a long decline over time. It is a decisive moment when discernment is taken away.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This verse shows that Edom—s problem will not only be external betrayal. Internally, they will lack the understanding needed to recognize danger or find a way out. Their collapse deepens from broken relationships to lost judgment.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Obadiah 1:9</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">Then your mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed,</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">To the end that everyone from the mountains of Esau</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">May be cut off by slaughter.</span> (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Obadiah prophecies the final stage of Edom—s collapse. After betrayal in verse 7 and loss of wisdom in verse 8, even Edom—s strength will fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The phrase <span data-custom-style="Strong"><em>“</em></span><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">your mighty men</span><span data-custom-style="Strong"><em>”</em></span> refers to Edom—s warriors, the people meant to defend the nation. <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">Teman</span> was a region known for strength and leadership within Edom, so naming it highlights that even the best and bravest will lose courage.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>To be <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">dismayed</span> means to be shaken, confused, and afraid. The verse is saying that Edom—s fighters will not stand firm. When courage fails, resistance collapses.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The result is stated plainly. Everyone from the mountains of Esau will be cut off. The strongholds Edom trusted and the warriors they relied on will not prevent destruction.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This verse completes the unraveling described in verses 7—9. Allies betray them, wisdom disappears, and strength fails. Nothing remains to hold Edom together.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Why this matters in the flow of the chapter</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This opening section prepares us for what follows. Before the Lord names Edom—s sins against her brother, He exposes the foundation beneath those sins. Pride made Edom blind. False security made her cruel. Self-reliance made her indifferent.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Only after these false supports are stripped away does the Lord explain the deeper moral failure that brought judgment. In this next section, the Lord lets Edom know why she is going to be judged</p>

<h3 id="verse-10-violence-against-a-brother">Verse 10 — Violence Against a Brother</h3>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Obadiah 1:10</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">For violence against your brother Jacob,</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">Shame shall cover you,</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">And you shall be cut off forever.</span> (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Here we read why everything described so far is happening. God names the cause directly. It is because of <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">violence against your brother Jacob</span>. Edom—s guilt is rooted in how they treated a people they were bound to by relationship.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Calling Jacob a <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">brother</span> brings the focus onto responsibility. This was not harm done to strangers or distant enemies. It was violence against those they were connected to, which makes the offense heavier.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The consequences are stated directly<span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">. Shame shall cover you</span> means Edom will be exposed and disgraced for what they did. <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">You shall be cut off forever</span> shows that this judgment is decisive and lasting.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This verse shifts the passage from describing Edom—s downfall to explaining its cause. It marks the turning point where God states clearly why the judgment is deserved.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="verse-11-first-reason-for-judgement-doing-nothing-while-israel-was-being-destroyed">Verse 11 — First reason for judgement: doing nothing while Israel was being destroyed</h3>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Obadiah 1:11<br />
In the day that you stood on the other side—<br />
In the day that strangers carried captive his forces,<br />
When foreigners entered his gates<br />
And cast lots for Jerusalem—<br />
Even you were as one of them. (NKJV)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This verse begins to explain <strong>what the violence in verse 10 looked like in real life</strong>. Edom did not have to raise a sword to be guilty. Their guilt began with <strong>standing on the other side</strong>. That phrase means they watched from a distance and chose not to act.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The verse places this in a specific moment: the day Jerusalem was attacked. Outsiders entered the city, carried people away, and divided the city—s goods by casting lots. These are the actions of enemies.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The key line is the last one. <em>“</em><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">Even you were as one of them</span><em>.”</em> By standing aside and doing nothing, Edom placed itself on the same side as the attackers. The verse is saying that indifference in a moment like this is not neutral. It counts as participation.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This verse moves the charge forward. The violence named earlier includes silence, distance, and refusal to stand with those being harmed.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="verse-12-second-reason-for-judgement-gloating-and-rejoicing-over-their-downfall">Verse 12 — Second reason for judgement: Gloating and Rejoicing over their downfall</h3>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p>Obadiah 1:12<br />
But you should not have gazed on the day of your brother In the day of his captivity; Nor should you have rejoiced over the children of Judah In the day of their destruction; Nor should you have spoken proudly In the day of distress. (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This verse moves the charge deeper. Edom—s guilt was not only that they stood aside; it was also how they <strong>responded</strong> to Judah—s suffering. The repeated phrase <em>“</em><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">in the day</span><em>”</em> keeps the focus on that same moment of disaster and presses the reader to see Edom—s actions as deliberate, not accidental.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>To <em>gaze</em> here means more than noticing. It means looking on with interest or satisfaction. The verse says Edom watched their brother—s downfall instead of turning away in grief.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Then God names their inner response. They <strong>rejoiced</strong> when Judah was destroyed. This was not silent indifference anymore; it was emotional approval of what was happening. They did not merely watch Judah—s fall; they rejoiced in it. They took pleasure in their brother—s distress.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Finally, the verse addresses their words. To <em>speak proudly</em> means they talked arrogantly or boastfully while Judah was in distress. Edom did not just feel the wrong things; they said them out loud.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This verse advances the accusation from passive distance to inward attitude and outward speech. Edom watched, took pleasure, and spoke as if they stood above the suffering of their brother.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p><strong>Psalms 137:7</strong> <em>Remember, O LORD, against the sons of Edom The day of Jerusalem, Who said, "Raze it, raze it, To its very foundation."</em> NASB</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This verse reveals that <span data-custom-style="Strong">rejoicing over another—s downfall matters deeply to God</span>. Pride expresses itself not only in strength, but in superiority felt over the weak. Gloating exposes an unloving and hardened heart.</p>
</div>

<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">In the day of their calamity.</span> (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Here, Edom goes from watching to taking part. They did not remain outside or at a distance while <span data-custom-style="Strong">Jerusalem</span> was under attack. They <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">entered the gate</span>, meaning they went into the city while it was already falling.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The repeated words <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">“</span><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">in the day of their calamity</span><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">”</span> keep pressing the timing. Edom acted at the exact moment when Jerusalem was weakest and most exposed. This was not later reflection or indirect involvement. It happened right in the middle of the disaster.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>God then spells out what that involvement looked like. Edom looked on Jerusalem—s suffering, and they did more than look. They <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">laid hands on their substance</span>, taking advantage of the chaos to seize property and wealth.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>At this point, Edom is no longer standing on the sidelines. They take advantage of Jerusalem—s suffering and use it for gain.</p>

<p>The Lord—s accusation reaches its most severe point here:<br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">“</span><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">You should not have stood at the crossroads to cut off their fugitives.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Edom did not merely profit. They actively prevented escape. They captured those fleeing destruction and handed them back over to the enemy.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This is the final stage of moral descent. What began with distance ends with active cruelty. The progression is intentional and sobering:</p>

For the day of the LORD upon all the nations is near;<br />
As you have done, it shall be done to you;<br />
Your reprisal shall return upon your own head. (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The Lord then places Edom—s actions within a broader framework:<br />
<span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">“For the day of the LORD is near upon all the nations.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This judgment is not limited to Edom alone. It reveals how God governs all nations. The principle is stated clearly: <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">“</span><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">As you have done, it shall be done to you.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>This is not revenge. It is justice. Here God tells them they will reap what they have sown. Judgment here is <span data-custom-style="Strong">measured and proportional</span>. Edom forced others to drink the cup of suffering and now they will drink it.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Scripture calls it <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">the day of the LORD,</span> meaning a time when God steps in and acts openly. What is happening to Edom is not accidental or delayed. God says this moment is near.</p>

<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">And they shall be as though they had never been.</span> (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>God uses a vivid image here to describe what judgment will feel like. To <span data-custom-style="Strong">drink</span> is to experience something fully, not lightly or at a distance.

<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>God then widens the scope. What Edom did is not unique. <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">All the nations</span> that act this way will drink in the same sense. This is not a one-off response. It is how God deals with pride and violence wherever they appear.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The language intensifies. To drink, then swallow, means being overwhelmed. The judgment is not brief or partial. It consumes.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The final line states the outcome plainly. To be <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">as though they had never been</span> means their presence, power, and influence are erased. What once seemed solid and lasting disappears.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Judgment here is pictured as unavoidable and complete. Those who treated God—s purposes lightly will be overtaken by the very thing they thought they could handle.</p>

<h3 id="verse-17-deliverance-and-holiness-on-mount-zion">Verse 17 — Deliverance and Holiness on Mount Zion</h3>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Obadiah 1:17</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">But on Mount Zion there shall be deliverance,</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">And there shall be holiness (H6944);</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">The house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.</span> (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Here, the focus shifts sharply from judgment to hope. While destruction is coming on Edom, God says <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">deliverance</span> will be found on Mount Zion. Jerusalem will not share the same end. God will preserve His people.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Mount Zion represents the place of God—s dwelling and rule. The promise of deliverance there signals that restoration begins with God—s presence, not merely political recovery. This is not simply escape from trouble; it is rescue rooted in God—s redemptive purposes.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The next phrase adds clarity. <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">There shall be holiness</span> means Zion will be set apart again for God. What was defiled by violence and suffering will not remain that way. God will restore what belongs to Him. Deliverance without holiness would only repeat the cycle of pride and failure. God—s restoration is moral and spiritual, not just external.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The final line points to reversal. <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">The house of Jacob shall possess their possessions</span> means what was lost will not stay lost. Land, inheritance, and identity will be restored. What Edom helped strip away will be returned.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Here, God makes the contrast unmistakable. Edom moves toward loss and disappearance, but Jacob moves toward rescue, restoration, and renewed purpose. The verse ends with promise of inheritance restored. What had been lost through judgment will not be lost forever. God is reclaiming what belongs to His people.</p>

<h3 id="verse-18-reversal-of-power-the-first-shall-be-last-and-the-last-shall-be-first">Verse 18 — Reversal of Power — the first shall be last and the last shall be first</h3>
<div class="MTB-Read">
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Obadiah 1:18</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">The house of Jacob shall be a fire,</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">And the house of Joseph a flame;</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">But the house of Esau shall be stubble;</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">They shall kindle them and devour them,</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">And no survivor shall remain of the house of Esau;</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">For the LORD has spoken.</span> (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>God uses a clear picture here. Jacob and Joseph are like fire and flame. Esau is like dry stubble. When fire meets stubble, there is no contest. It is quickly consumed.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The point is simple. Esau will not be able to stand. What once looked strong will disappear when God acts and moves through His restored, holy people.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>When God says that no survivor will remain, He is saying this will be the end. Esau—s line will not recover or rise again.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>And then God closes it Himself: <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">“</span><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">For the LORD has spoken</span><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">.”</span> Nothing more needs to be said. What He declares will happen. This outcome does not depend on chance or human strength. It rests on God—s word.</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Obadiah 1:19</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">The South shall possess the mountains of Esau,</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">And the Lowland shall possess Philistia.</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">They shall possess the fields of Ephraim and the fields of Samaria;</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">Benjamin shall possess Gilead.</span> (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Here, God speaks about what restoration will look like in real, visible terms. He talks about land changing hands. What had been held by enemies or lost through conflict will be taken back.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The regions named represent areas that once stood outside Israel—s control or were lost through conflict. By saying these areas will be possessed, the verse is saying that what was taken or denied will be reclaimed.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Each group named corresponds to a place they did not previously hold. The South taking the mountains of Esau shows Edom—s territory being absorbed. The Lowland taking Philistia points to former enemies no longer holding power. Ephraim, Samaria, and Gilead being possessed shows unity and restoration across regions that had been divided. This is not a small or local recovery. What was scattered and divided will be gathered and restored.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>What—s being described is not expansion for its own sake. It is reversal. Territory that symbolized defeat and vulnerability now becomes part of renewed stability and belonging.</p>

<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">And the captives of this host of the children of Israel</span><br />

<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">The captives of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad</span><br />
<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">Shall possess the cities of the South.</span> (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>God now speaks about people who were scattered and carried away. These are <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">captives</span>, not those who stayed behind. They were removed from their land and pushed far from home.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>The places named point to distance. <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">Zarephath</span> lies well to the north, outside Israel—s usual borders. <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">Sepharad</span> refers to a far-off place of exile. The point is not the exact locations, but how far these people had been taken.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>God says those very people will <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">possess</span> land and cities again. That word signals more than return. It means belonging, stability, and inheritance restored.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>What had been lost through defeat and exile will not stay lost. Even those who were far away are included in what God is doing. Restoration reaches as far as the scattering once did.</p>

<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">And the kingdom shall be the LORD—s.</span> (NKJV)</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>God ends the book by lifting the focus from events to authority. He speaks of <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">saviors</span> coming to <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">Mount Zion</span>. These are believers raised up to carry out what God has already declared. They act on His behalf, not on their own.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p>Mount Zion remains the center. What God does flows from where He has chosen to place His rule. From there, judgment reaches <span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">the mountains of Esau</span>, meaning Edom—s strength, territory, and pride are finally brought under account.</p>
</div>
<div class="MTB-Explain">
<p><span class="MTB-Text-Highlight">The kingdom shall be the LORD—s.</span> That is where everything in human history is headed. This is not only about Edom—s fall or Israel—s recovery. It is about who truly rules. This is our ultimate hope of the book. Human pride does not endure. Cruelty does not reign forever. God—s rule stands. Human power, violence, and betrayal do not decide the outcome of history. God does.</p>
