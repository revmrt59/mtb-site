<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>HOUSE OF JOSEPH — (<em>bêṯ yôsep̄</em>, Strong’s H1004 / H3130)</strong> Refers to the northern tribes of Israel (primarily Ephraim and Manasseh), representing the "preeminence" of the northern kingdom. While the "house of Jacob" represents the whole, the <strong>house of Joseph</strong> specifically highlights the "faithful" strength and "saving health" of the northern remnant.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 18</strong>, the <strong>house of Joseph</strong> is described as a "flame". This "weighty" imagery signifies that when the "Day of the LORD" arrives, the northern and southern tribes will be unified in "integrity" to "kindle" the fire that "devours" the "malicious" house of Esau.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H1004 (<em>bêṯ</em>):</strong> Meaning a house, family, or household.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H3130 (<em>yôsep̄</em>):</strong> Meaning "may He add" or "He shall add".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The name Joseph carries the "testimony" of "increase" and "deliverance" from "shame". To be the <strong>house of Joseph</strong> is to be part of the "divine reality" where God adds "strength" to His "special people" after a season of "distress".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Biblical Profile and Significance</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame of Unity: Rejoining the House of Jacob</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Historically, the <strong>house of Joseph</strong> was separated from Judah, leading to national "chaos" and "insubordinate" walks.</p></li>
<li><p>Obadiah’s prophecy presents a "divine reality" where the "fire" (Jacob) and the "flame" (Joseph) operate as one "sound" unit against the "house of Esau".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Instrument of Consumption: Devouring the Stubble</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While the <strong>house of Joseph</strong> suffered its own "complete stripping" during the Assyrian invasion, God promises a "pivotal" reversal.</p></li>
<li><p>They are not just survivors of "calamity"; they are the "flame" that ensures "no survivor shall remain" of the "house of Esau" because of Edom's "violence" and "pride".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Source of Truth: For the LORD Has Spoken</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The "preeminence" of the <strong>house of Joseph</strong> in this battle is guaranteed by the "Word of the LORD".</p></li>
<li><p>Their "walk" in the "Day of the LORD" will be one of "sober" execution of God's "order," replacing the "empty talk" of the nations with the "reality" of His "kingdom".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Insight</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>house of Joseph</strong> teaches us that God "adds" to our "integrity" when we align with His "order". Even after being "cut off" or "stripped" by "chaos," the "faithful" can trust that they will be restored as a "flame" for the LORD’s "testimony". To find "soul prosperity," we must "reverence" the "Source of Truth," knowing that He will unify His people to "possess" the "saving health" of "Mount Zion".</p>
