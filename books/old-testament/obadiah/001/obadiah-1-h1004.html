<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>HOUSE OF JACOB — (<em>bêṯ ya‘ăqōḇ</em>, Strong’s H1004 / H3290)</strong> Refers to the entire nation of Israel as the biological and covenantal descendants of the patriarch Jacob. It represents the "special people" whom God chose as His own "inheritance" and "house of prayer".</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 18</strong>, the <strong>"house of Jacob"</strong> is described as a "fire." This represents a "weighty" reversal of their previous "shame" and "calamity". While they were once "stripped" and "delivered up" by Edom, the "divine reality" is that they will become the instrument of God’s "judgment," consuming the "house of Esau" as "stubble".</p>

<p><strong>2. Biblical Profile and Significance</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Covenant People: From Deception to Preeminence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>house of Jacob</strong> is the national "testimony" of God’s grace—taking a man once known for "shrewdness" and "empty talk" and making his descendants a "kingdom" of priests.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite their "insubordinate" seasons and "natural pressure points" of judgment, the "Word of the LORD" remains "faithful" to preserve them as a "remnant".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Instrument of Judgment: A Holy Fire</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In Obadiah, the <strong>house of Jacob</strong> is the "fire" that executes the "Day of the LORD".</p></li>
<li><p>This signifies that the "sanctity" and "holiness" of God’s people will eventually "devour" the "malicious" pride of those who "despised" them.</p></li>
<li><p>While Edom "gazed" on their "destruction," the "divine reality" is that the "house of Jacob" will witness the "complete stripping" of the house of Esau.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Restored Inheritance: Soul Prosperity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The end of the "house of Jacob’s" struggle is the "peace" of possessing their "possessions" (v. 17).</p></li>
<li><p>They move from "distress" and "shame" to a "saving health" where "the kingdom shall be the LORD’S" (v. 21).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Insight</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>house of Jacob</strong> reminds us that being "special people" to God involves both "weighty" discipline and "preeminent" restoration. When we "walk" through our own "calamity," we must remain "sober" and "faithful," knowing that our "integrity" is anchored in the "Source of Truth". To be part of this "house" is to find "soul prosperity" even when surrounded by "chaos," trusting that God’s "order" will eventually "deliver" us from every "violence".</p>
