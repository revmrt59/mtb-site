<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>EDOM — (<em>’Ĕḏôm</em>, Strong’s H123)</strong> The name means <strong>"red."</strong> It refers to <strong>Esau</strong>, the twin brother of Jacob, who famously traded his birthright for a bowl of "red pottage" (Gen 25:30) and settled in the rugged, reddish sandstone cliffs of Mount Seir.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 1:1</strong>, Edom is the primary subject of God’s decree. The nation serves as a sobering "testimony" to the danger of pride; their "high habitation" in the mountain fortresses could not shield them from the "weight" of divine judgment after they treated their brother, Israel, with "malicious" contempt.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study (Lexical)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H123:</strong> Meaning "Red".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>’āḏōm</em> (to be red), which shares a root with <em>’āḏām</em> (man/mankind) and <em>’ăḏāmâ</em> (ground/earth).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> This linguistic link to "earth" and "humanity" highlights Edom's focus on the physical and temporal. They chose the "red" of the earth over the "spiritual weight" of the covenant, creating a deep "integrity gap" that lasted for generations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Biblical Profile and Significance</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Origin: The Bitter Brother</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Edom is the nation descended from Esau, Jacob's twin.</p></li>
<li><p>Their national identity was forged in a "root of bitterness" following the lost blessing, manifesting as a perpetual "insubordinate" attitude toward Israel.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Geography: The Pride of the High Habitation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Edom occupied the region south of the Dead Sea, characterized by "clefts of the rock" and nearly impregnable mountain fortresses like Sela.</p></li>
<li><p>This rugged terrain of "high habitations" fostered a false sense of security and a spirit of "insubordinate" pride, leading them to believe their "fortress" was beyond the reach of any foe (v. 3).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Conflict: Perennial Enmity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Throughout the Old Testament, Edom acted as a constant "natural pressure point" for Israel.</p></li>
<li><p>Their hostility was historic: from refusing Moses and the Israelites passage during the Exodus (Num 20:14–21) to cheering the "chaos" of Jerusalem's destruction in 586 B.C. (Ps 137:7), Edom represents the "malicious" neighbor who rejoices in the suffering of God's people.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Symbolism: The Flesh vs. The Spirit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In prophetic literature, Edom is often a "type" or representative of the "unregenerate flesh" and the world system that opposes God's "special people".</p></li>
<li><p>They are labeled the "border of wickedness" (Mal 1:4), contrasting with the "saving health" and holiness intended for Zion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Insight</strong></p>
<p>Edom is a "divine reality" check that our "walk" matters more than our "walls." No "high habitation" or "pride of heart" can protect those who treat the "brethren" with violence or the "truth" with contempt. To choose the "red" of the earth over the "truth" of the Word is to trade an eternal inheritance for a temporary "habitation" that will eventually be "searched out" and brought down.</p>
