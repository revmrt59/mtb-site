<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>CONFEDERACY — (<em>bĕrît</em>, Strong’s H1285)</strong> Refers to a covenant, alliance, or treaty; it is a formal agreement between two parties that binds them together for mutual benefit or protection.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 7</strong>, the prophet warns, "All the men in your <strong>confederacy</strong> shall force you to the border." This exposes the "integrity gap" in Edom’s political alliances; they relied on human "covenants" rather than the "Source of Truth," and those very allies would eventually become the agents of their "chaos" and betrayal.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H1285:</strong> Meaning a covenant, league, or confederacy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Likely derived from a root meaning "to cut," referencing the ancient practice of "cutting a covenant" by passing between the pieces of a sacrificed animal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The root emphasizes the "binding" nature of the agreement. It is a "weighty" commitment that creates a shared "identity" and "testimony" between the parties involved.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Cut Sacrifice:</strong> Used to describe the solemn ritual where parties acknowledged that if they broke the <em>bĕrît</em>, they should suffer the same fate as the sacrificed animals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Shared Table:</strong> It carries the image of "men at peace" who eat bread together, signifying a level of "hospitality" and "faithful" friendship.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a chain; a confederacy is only as strong as its weakest "integrity" link. Edom’s chain was forged in "pride" and "malicious" intent, leading to a violent "breaking".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>confederacy (H1285)</strong> without God is a form of "insubordinate" self-reliance. It reflects the "divine reality" that human alliances are prone to "empty talk" and betrayal if they are not anchored in "reverence" for the LORD. For Edom, their <em>bĕrît</em> was a "deception" that provided a false sense of "peace" while they were actually being led to their own "destruction".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 7</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"All the men in your confederacy (bĕrît) shall force you to the border..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah highlights the irony of Edom’s judgment: those who shared their "bread" and "confederacy" would be the ones to "deceive" and "prevail" against them.</p></li>
<li><p>This "betrayal" is the "natural pressure point" God uses to strip Edom of their "preeminence," showing that no "league" of men can stand against the "testimony" of the LORD.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Genesis 15:18:</strong> "On the same day the LORD made a <strong>covenant (bĕrît)</strong> with Abram..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exodus 19:5:</strong> "...if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My <strong>covenant (bĕrît)</strong>, then you shall be a special treasure to Me..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 83:5:</strong> "For they have consulted together with one consent; they form a <strong>confederacy (bĕrît)</strong> against You."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>Where do we place our trust? A "confederacy" with the world may offer temporary "peace," but it often leads to "chaos" and an "integrity gap" that leaves us vulnerable. To find true "soul prosperity" and "saving health," our primary "covenant" must be with the "Source of Truth". Only in His "bĕrît" can we find a "safe voyage" that remains "faithful" to the end.</p>
