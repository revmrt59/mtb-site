<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>PROUDLY — (<em>gāḏal</em>, Strong’s H1431)</strong> In the <strong>NKJV</strong> of <strong>Obadiah 12</strong>, this refers to the act of "magnifying" or "making great" one's speech; it describes an arrogant expansion of the self at the expense of another.</p>
<p>God rebukes Edom for having "<strong>spoken proudly</strong>" (literally, "magnified the mouth") in the day of Israel's distress. This was the "divine reality" of their "integrity gap": while their brother Jacob was being brought low, Edom was "magnifying" their own "preeminence" through "malicious" boasting.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H1431:</strong> Meaning to grow, to become great, or to magnify.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root meaning to "twist" or "braid" together, hence to "grow" or "become large".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The word is often used for God’s greatness, but when used of man’s heart or mouth, it indicates an "insubordinate" attempt to exceed his proper "order". In Obadiah, it describes a "walk" of pride where one's ego is "braided" into a "weighty" display of "arrogance".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Towering Tree:</strong> Used to describe something that grows tall and "preeminent"; Edom felt "great" in their "high habitation" and reflected that "pride" in their speech.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Magnified Voice:</strong> To speak <strong>proudly</strong> carries the image of someone "making their mouth large" to "shout" over the "chaos" of another's life, filling the air with "empty talk".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a balloon being over-inflated; to speak <strong>proudly (H1431)</strong> is to expand the ego until it creates a "natural pressure point" that eventually leads to a violent "shattering".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>Speaking <strong>proudly (H1431)</strong> is an act of "defiance" against the "Word of the LORD". It reflects a heart that has lost "reverence" for the "special people" of God and has instead made its own "preeminence" the "source" of its "peace". For Edom, this "magnification" of their own "testimony" during Israel’s "shame" ensured their own "complete stripping".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 12</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...Nor should you have spoken proudly (gāḏal) in the day of distress."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah targets the "malicious" timing of Edom's pride; they used their "mouth" as a weapon of "violence" when they should have been offering "saving health".</p></li>
<li><p>This "pride" was the evidence that Edom was "faithful" only to themselves, choosing to "walk" in the "chaos" of the "nations" rather than in the "integrity" of the covenant.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 35:26:</strong> "Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who <strong>exalt (gāḏal)</strong> themselves against me."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 55:12:</strong> "...Nor has he who hates me <strong>exalted (gāḏal)</strong> himself [spoken proudly] against me..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lamentations 1:9:</strong> "...O LORD, behold my affliction, for the enemy has <strong>exalted (gāḏal)</strong> himself!"</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To have "soul prosperity," we must "magnify" the LORD rather than our own "mouth". When we speak <strong>proudly</strong> at the expense of others, we create an "integrity gap" that God promises to fill with "shame". We must remain "sober" and "temperate," ensuring our "testimony" is anchored in "reverence" for God’s "saving health" so that we are never "cut off" for our own "arrogance".</p>
