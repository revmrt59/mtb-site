<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>NATIONS — (<em>gôy</em>, Strong’s H1471)</strong> Refers to a people, a community, or a collective body of individuals; in a prophetic context, it specifically refers to the non-Hebrew ethnic groups or "Gentiles".</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 1:1</strong>, the messenger is sent "among the <strong>nations</strong>." This identifies the judgment of Edom as a global "testimony". God is not only the God of Israel but the sovereign Ruler over all <em>gôyîm</em>, summoning them to execute His "weighty" decree against "insubordinate" pride.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H1471:</strong> Meaning a nation, people, or Gentile.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from a root meaning "to be a mass" or "a body".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The word originally referred to a "body" of people who were related by a common government or territory. While <em>‘am</em> is often used for a "covenant people" (like Israel), <em>gôy</em> is frequently used for the "nations of the world" who are outside that specific covenant relationship.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Swarming Mass:</strong> Used to describe a vast "body" of people moving together, like a "swarm of locusts" (Joel 1:6); it reflects the "chaos" that can ensue when the <em>gôyîm</em> are not aligned with the "Source of Truth".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Territorial Boundary:</strong> It carries the image of groups defined by their "borders" rather than their "spirit," emphasizing the "natural pressure points" of geopolitical conflict.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a large field of various crops; each "nation" has its own "identity," but the Master of the Vineyard (the LORD) has authority over the harvest of every single one.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>nations (H1471)</strong> are the theater where God displays His "integrity" and "reverence". It reflects the "divine reality" that no people group is hidden from His sight; even those who consider themselves "preeminent" or "high" are subject to His "saving health" or His judgment.</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 1:1</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...And a messenger has been sent among the nations (gôyîm)..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah emphasizes that Edom's "evil deeds" are being broadcast to the other "nations" to serve as a "sound" warning.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>gôyîm</em> are called to "rise up," proving that God can use even those who do not "know" Him to perform His "faithful" work of justice.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Genesis 12:2:</strong> "I will make you a great <strong>nation (gôy)</strong>; I will bless you..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 2:1:</strong> "Why do the <strong>nations (gôyîm)</strong> rage, and the people plot a vain thing?"</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isaiah 11:12:</strong> "He will set up a banner for the <strong>nations (gôyîm)</strong>..."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>God’s heart is for all "nations." While we often focus on our own "natural pressure points," we must remember that the "Gospel" is intended to reach every <em>gôy</em>. To "walk" in the truth is to look past our own "borders" and see others as "special people" who need the "saving health" of the "Source of Truth".</p>
