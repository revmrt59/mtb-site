<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>LOTS — (<em>gôrāl</em>, Strong’s H1486)</strong> The name refers to a <strong>"small stone"</strong> or pebble used to make decisions. In the biblical world, "casting lots" was a method used to bypass human "shrewdness" and appeal directly to divine "order".</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 11</strong>, the practice is seen in its most "malicious" form: foreigners "cast lots for Jerusalem," treating God’s "special people" as common "spoils" of war. While the world uses the lot to foster "chaos" and plunder, the Bible reveals that the "outcome" of every lot is ultimately a "divine reality" held in the hand of the LORD.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H1486:</strong> Meaning a lot, a pebble, or an allotted portion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from an unused root meaning "to be rough" (like a stone).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The word identifies the physical object used, but its usage throughout the "Word of the LORD" shifts from the object to the <strong>destiny</strong> it represents. To have a <em>gôrāl</em> is to have a "faithful" inheritance or a "testimony" assigned by God.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Biblical Profile and Significance</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sacred Use: Discerning Divine Order</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the "house of prayer" and the life of Israel, lots were used to remove human "preeminence" from the decision-making process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Land:</strong> Joshua divided the Promised Land by lot (Josh 14:2), ensuring each tribe received their "allotted" portion without the "chaos" of favoritism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Scapegoat:</strong> On the Day of Atonement, the High Priest cast lots to determine which goat would provide "saving health" as a sacrifice and which would carry the sins away (Lev 16:8).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Profane Use: The Plunder of the Nations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conversely, the "nations" used lots as a "natural pressure point" for greed and "violence".</p></li>
<li><p>In Obadiah, the "foreigners" cast lots for Jerusalem, treating the "beloved" city like a "weightless" prize in a game of chance.</p></li>
<li><p>This act is the ultimate "integrity gap"—treating the eternal "covenant" city as if its future was subject to the "empty talk" of a rolling stone.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Providence: God Over the Stones</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Bible provides a "divine reality" check: "The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD" (Prov 16:33).</p></li>
<li><p>Even when "malicious" men like Haman cast the "Pur" (the lot) to destroy the Jews (Esther 3:7), God turned the "chaos" into a "safe voyage" for His people and "destruction" for their enemies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Insight</strong></p>
<p>Casting lots reminds us that there is no such thing as "luck" in the Kingdom of God. The world may try to "cast lots" for our peace, our reputation, or our "soul prosperity," but our "allotted portion" is secure in the "Word of the LORD". When we "walk" in "reverence" and "integrity," we can rest knowing that while the "stones" may be thrown by men, the "outcome" is governed by the One who calls us His "special people".</p>
