<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>CAPTIVES — (<em>gālūṯ</em>, Strong’s H1546)</strong> Refers to a body of exiles, a group of people removed from their land, or the state of being "stripped" of one’s home and heritage.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 20</strong>, the "testimony" changes from the "shame" of exile to the "preeminence" of restoration. God declares that the <strong>"captives"</strong> of this "host" of Israel shall "possess" the land of their enemies. This is the "divine reality" of a "safe voyage" home: those who were "delivered up" to "chaos" and "distress" are now empowered by the "Word of the LORD" to reclaim their "integrity" and "soul prosperity".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H1546:</strong> Meaning captivity, exiles, or a banished company.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>gālâ</em> (H1540), meaning to "uncover," "reveal," or "go into exile".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The word carries the "weighty" image of being "made naked" or "completely stripped" of one's national "habitation".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Uncovered Land:</strong> To be <strong>captives</strong> is to be "exposed" to the "violence" and "malicious" gaze of the "nations," much like a field that has been "stripped" of its cover.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Banished Company:</strong> It describes a "host" of people who "walk" in a foreign land, having lost their "peace" and "saving health" due to an "insubordinate" past.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a plant uprooted and carried to a "parched place"; to be <strong>captives (H1546)</strong> is to exist in a "natural pressure point" far from the "Source of Truth".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>The state of being <strong>captives (H1546)</strong> is a "divine reality" used to "search out" the heart of a people. While Edom "gazed" on the "captives" with "pride," God used the exile to refine the "remnant". The "Word of the LORD" promises that "reverence" for Him leads to a "safe voyage" out of "shame" and back into "preeminence".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 20</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"And the captives (gālūṯ) of this host of the children of Israel shall possess the land..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah highlights the "reversal" of fortunes; the "captives" who were "cut off" (v. 14) now "possess" the "fields" of their former oppressors.</p></li>
<li><p>This "testimony" proves that "integrity" is restored when the "special people" return to the "order" of the "kingdom".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Isaiah 20:4:</strong> "So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians... and the Ethiopians <strong>captives (gālūṯ)</strong>, young and old, naked and barefoot..." (The "complete stripping" of nations).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ezekiel 1:1:</strong> "...as I was among the <strong>captives (gālūṯ)</strong> by the River Chebar, that the heavens were opened..." (A "divine reality" in the midst of "distress").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Amos 1:6:</strong> "...Because they carried away <strong>captive (gālūṯ)</strong> the whole captivity to deliver them up to Edom.".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To have "soul prosperity," we must trust God even when we feel like <strong>captives</strong> to our circumstances. When we "walk" in "integrity," our seasons of being "stripped" or "cut off" become a "natural pressure point" for God to "reveal" His "saving health". Let us remain "faithful" and "sober," knowing that the "Word of the LORD" is the "Source of Truth" that will "deliver" us and restore our "habitation" in "peace".</p>
