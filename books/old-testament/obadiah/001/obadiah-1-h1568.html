<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>GILEAD — (<em>gil‘āḏ</em>, Strong’s H1568)</strong> A mountainous region east of the Jordan River known for its lush pasturelands and its healing "balm". It represents a "weighty" frontier of the "house of Jacob".</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 19</strong>, the prophecy declares that "Benjamin shall possess <strong>Gilead</strong>." This is a "divine reality" of total geographic restoration. While the "nations" and the "house of Esau" had "stripped" Israel’s eastern territories and left them in "chaos," the "Day of the LORD" ensures that even the most distant "habitation" is returned to the "special people" as a place of "peace" and "saving health."</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H1568:</strong> Meaning "heap of witness" or "rocky region".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>gal</em> (H1530), a heap of stones, and <em>‘ēḏ</em> (H5707), a witness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The name commemorates the "integrity" of the covenant between Jacob and Laban, where a "heap" was set up as a "testimony" of their boundaries.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Biblical Profile and Significance</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Land of Healing: The Balm of Gilead</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Gilead</strong> was famous for its "saving health," producing a medicinal resin used to treat "affliction" and "distress".</p></li>
<li><p>Jeremiah later asks, "Is there no balm in <strong>Gilead</strong>?"—highlighting that the "chaos" of a nation's "walk" cannot be healed when they "despise" God's "Word."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Frontier of Benjamin: Expanding the Heritage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah specifies that <strong>Benjamin</strong> (the smallest tribe) will "possess" <strong>Gilead</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>This represents a "pivotal" expansion; the "preeminence" of God's "order" allows even the "little" among the "remnant" to "possess" a vast and "weighty" inheritance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Witness Reclaimed: A Final Testimony</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>As a "heap of witness," <strong>Gilead</strong> stands as a "natural pressure point" for the surrounding "nations".</p></li>
<li><p>Its restoration to Israel proves that God is "faithful" to the markers He has set; no "malicious" neighbor like Edom can permanently "cut off" what God has "allotted" for "Jacob."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Insight</strong></p>
<p>The profile of <strong>Gilead</strong> teaches us that God’s "order" provides "healing" for every "calamity". When we "walk" in "reverence," we find that even the "rocky" frontiers of our lives are turned into a "safe habitation" of "soul prosperity". To "possess" our "Gilead" is to trust that the LORD will "deliver" us from "violence" and restore the "saving health" of our "testimony" before the world.</p>
