<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>KINDLE — (<em>dālaq</em>, Strong’s H1814)</strong> Refers to the act of setting on fire, burning, or hotly pursuing; it describes a "weighty" and intense consumption that spreads rapidly.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 18</strong>, the "house of Jacob" and "house of Joseph" shall <strong>"kindle"</strong> the "house of Esau". This is the "divine reality" of judgment: the "special people" who were "maliciously" pursued and "stripped" by Edom will now "hotly pursue" and consume their enemies with the "fire" of God’s "order".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H1814:</strong> Meaning to burn, to kindle, or to "pursue hotly".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root describing the ignition of a flame or the "inflamed" state of a pursuer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The word captures the "natural pressure point" of a fire catching hold; it is the moment "chaos" is transformed into "destruction" for the "insubordinate".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Hot Pursuit:</strong> Used to describe an enemy "hotly pursuing" a victim; it reflects the "violence" Edom once showed to Israel, which is now "returning upon their own head".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Inflamed Eye:</strong> It carries the image of an eye "burning" with "malicious" intent or a heart "kindled" with "pride".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a spark landing in "stubble" (v. 18); to <strong>kindle (H1814)</strong> is to initiate a "complete stripping" that cannot be quenched by "empty talk".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>kindle (H1814)</strong> is the execution of the "Day of the LORD". It proves the "integrity" of God’s Word: those who "walk" in "wickedness" provide the fuel for their own "destruction". For the "house of Esau," who "despised" their brother, the "divine reality" is a "fire" that they themselves "kindled" through their "insubordinate" actions.</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 18</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...They shall kindle (dālaq) them and devour them, and no survivor shall remain of the house of Esau..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah uses this word to show that the judgment is active and thorough; it is not a slow burn but a "hot pursuit" that leaves "nothing".</p></li>
<li><p>This "kindling" is the "testimony" that God’s "sanctity" will eventually "consume" all "chaos".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Genesis 31:36:</strong> "...What is my sin, that you have so <strong>hotly pursued [kindled after] (dālaq)</strong> me?"</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 7:13:</strong> "...He makes His arrows <strong>fiery [kindled] (dālaq)</strong> shafts."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isaiah 5:11:</strong> "...who continue until night, till wine <strong>inflames [kindles] (dālaq)</strong> them!" (A loss of "sober" discipline).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To find "soul prosperity," we must ensure we are not "kindling" a "fire" of "malicious" pride in our own hearts. When we "walk" in "integrity," our lives become a "flame" of "saving health" rather than a "fire" of "destruction". Let us "reverence" the "Source of Truth," knowing that the only way to escape being "kindled" as "stubble" is to be "faithful" to the "Word of the LORD".</p>
