<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>MOUNT ZION — (<em>har ṣiyyôn</em>, Strong’s H2022 / H6726)</strong> The specific mountain in Jerusalem where the Temple was built; it represents the "habitation" of God and the "center" of His "divine reality" on earth. While the "mountains of Esau" were built on "pride" and "violence," <strong>Mount Zion</strong> is the foundation of "holiness" and "reverence".</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 17</strong>, God promises that "on <strong>Mount Zion</strong> there shall be deliverance." This marks the "pivotal" shift in the prophecy: while the "nations" face "destruction" and "chaos," Zion becomes a place of "saving health" and a "safe voyage" for the "faithful" remnant.</p>

<p><strong>2. Biblical Profile and Significance</strong></p>
<p><strong>The House of Prayer: Sanctuary for the Remnant</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mount Zion</strong> is the "Source of Truth" in a world of "empty talk".</p></li>
<li><p>It is the location of the "house of prayer" where the "soul prosperity" of Israel was cultivated through "reverence" for the LORD.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Reversal of Shame: Deliverance and Holiness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Though Zion experienced a "natural pressure point" when foreigners entered its gates (v. 11), God promises a "restoration" of its "sanctity".</p></li>
<li><p>Obadiah 17 declares that Zion will be "holy," meaning it will be "cut off" from the "malicious" touch of the nations and set apart for the LORD’S "peace".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Seat of Government: Judging the Nations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The prophecy concludes with "saviors" coming to <strong>Mount Zion</strong> to "judge" the mountains of Esau (v. 21).</p></li>
<li><p>It represents the "divine reality" that God’s "order" will eventually "strip" all "insubordinate" powers of their authority, establishing the "kingdom" as the LORD’S.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Insight</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mount Zion</strong> reminds us that there is a "safe habitation" for those who "walk" in "integrity". While the "mountains" of this world may seem "mighty" and "secure," they are prone to "chaos" and "complete destruction" if they "despise" the "Source of Truth". To find "saving health," we must align our lives with the "holiness" of Zion, trusting that the LORD will lead us through every "distress" to our true "inheritance".</p>
