<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>PRIDE — (<em>zāḏôn</em>, Strong’s H2087)</strong> Refers to arrogance, insolence, or a swelling of self-importance that leads to rebellious and presumptuous behavior.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 3</strong>, God confronts Edom, saying, "The <strong>pride</strong> of your heart has deceived you." This identifies their core "natural pressure point"—an inflated sense of "preeminence" that blinded them to the "divine reality" of their own vulnerability before the "Source of Truth".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H2087:</strong> Meaning arrogance, presumptuousness, or pride.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>zîḏ</em> (to boil, seethe, or act proudly/presumptuously).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The root <em>zîḏ</em> carries the vivid imagery of water "boiling over" a pot. It describes a heart that is so heated by its own "chaos" and ambition that it spills over into "insubordinate" and "malicious" actions against others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Boiling Cauldron:</strong> Used to describe a person or nation that has "overheated" with self-reliance, resulting in a loss of "temperate" and "sober-minded" judgment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Swelling Tide:</strong> It carries the image of a river rising above its "borders," encroaching on territory that does not belong to it—much like Edom encroached on Israel's suffering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a balloon being overinflated; it looks "weighty" and large, but it is actually filled with "empty talk" (air) and is prone to a sudden and "complete destruction".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pride (H2087)</strong> is the primary "integrity gap" that separates a soul from God. It reflects a refusal to "reverently" submit to the LORD, choosing instead to "walk" in a "presumptuous" way that ignores "sound doctrine". In the "House of Prayer," pride is the "chaos" that must be replaced by "peace" and humility for a soul to "prosper".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 3</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"The pride (zāḏôn) of your heart has deceived you..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>John (the Spirit through the prophet) uses this to show that Edom’s "high habitation" was not their strength, but their snare.</p></li>
<li><p>Their pride was a "deception" that made them think they were "impregnable," proving that when a person is "insubordinate" to God, they eventually become a "victim" of their own "arrogance".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Samuel 17:28:</strong> "...I know your <strong>pride (zāḏôn)</strong> and the insolence of your heart..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 11:2:</strong> "When <strong>pride (zāḏôn)</strong> comes, then comes shame; but with the humble is wisdom."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jeremiah 49:16:</strong> "Your fierceness has deceived you, the <strong>pride (zāḏôn)</strong> of your heart..." (The parallel prophecy against Edom).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>Pride is the "boiling" heart that leads to a "broken" walk. When we allow our own success or "security" to make us feel "preeminent," we are in danger of being "deceived". To maintain "soul prosperity," we must keep our hearts "cool" through "reverence" and "temperate" living, ensuring that our "weight" comes from the "Source of Truth" rather than our own "swelling" ego.</p>
