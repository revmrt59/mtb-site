<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>STRANGERS — (<em>zār</em>, Strong’s H2114)</strong> Refers to those who are outside of a specific family, group, or covenant; it often describes foreigners, aliens, or "unauthorized" persons who have no rightful claim to a possession.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 11</strong>, the prophet rebukes Edom for standing by "in the day that <strong>strangers</strong> carried away captive [Israel's] forces." This highlights the "integrity gap" of the Edomites: they watched as "outsiders" plundered their own brother, Jacob, treating the "special people" of God as though they were "empty" and worthless.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H2114:</strong> Meaning a stranger, foreigner, or one who is "strange" to a covenant.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>zûr</em> (to turn aside, to be a stranger, or to be loathsome).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The root suggests a "turning aside" from the proper or "sound" path. A <em>zār</em> is not just someone from another land; in a spiritual sense, it is anyone who has "turned away" from the "Source of Truth" and acts with "insubordinate" disregard for God's "order".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Unauthorized Intruder:</strong> Used to describe "strange fire" or "strange incense" offered by those who have no "reverence" for the "house of prayer".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Loathsome Guest:</strong> It carries the image of something that has become "alien" or "corrupt," like a once-faithful friend who has become "malicious" and "empty" toward his neighbor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a thief entering a home where he does not belong; the <em>zār</em> brings "chaos" to a place that should be a "safe habitation".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>The presence of <strong>strangers (H2114)</strong> in the gates of Jerusalem was the ultimate "natural pressure point" for Israel. It reflected the "divine reality" that because of their own "insubordinate" walk, God allowed "unauthorized" nations to "strip" them of their "preeminence". For Edom, standing with these "strangers" against their own kin was a "malicious" choice that lead to their own "complete destruction".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 11</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"In the day that you stood on the other side—In the day that strangers (zārîm) carried away captive his forces..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah uses this term to emphasize Edom’s "shame"; they were family, yet they acted as "strangers" to their brother’s pain.</p></li>
<li><p>By aligning themselves with the "strangers," Edom forfeited their own "peace" and "saving health," choosing instead to be "cut off" like the very foreigners they cheered for.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Exodus 30:9:</strong> "You shall not offer <strong>strange (zār)</strong> incense on it, or a burnt offering..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 54:3:</strong> "For <strong>strangers (zārîm)</strong> have risen up against me, and oppressors have sought after my soul..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 2:16:</strong> "To deliver you from the immoral woman, from the <strong>seducer (zārâ)</strong> who flatters with her words..."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To avoid becoming a "stranger" to God's "peace," we must "walk" in "reverence" and "faithfulness". When we "turn aside" from the "Source of Truth" to follow "empty talk" or "malicious" desires, we create an "integrity gap" that leaves us "isolated" and "disdained". True "soul prosperity" is found in remaining "faithful" to our "covenant" with the LORD and our "brethren".</p>
