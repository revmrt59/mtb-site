<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>VISION — (<em>ḥāzôn</em>, Strong’s H2377)</strong> Refers to a divine revelation, a prophetic sight, or an oracle communicated by God to a seer.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 1</strong>, the prophecy begins with "The <strong>vision</strong> of Obadiah." This identifies the message not as a product of human observation or political analysis, but as a supernatural "seeing" of God's sovereign decree regarding the nations.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Hebrew Roots / Derivation</strong></p>
<p>Derived from the verb <em>ḥāzâ</em>, meaning "to see," "perceive," or "gaze". While <em>mar’eh</em> (another word for vision) often focuses on the outward appearance, <em>ḥāzôn</em> emphasizes the internal, spiritual perception of a divine message.</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong></p>
<p>A revelation from God; an oracle or a prophetic dream. It signifies a mode of communication where God presents a "mental picture" or a direct word to the prophet's spirit, which then must be declared to the people.</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Watchman's Gaze:</strong> Used to describe a watchman looking into the distance to perceive what is coming before it is visible to others.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Open Eye:</strong> It carries the image of an eye being "opened" by God to look behind the veil of current events into the spiritual reality of His judgment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a flash of lightning in a dark forest that suddenly reveals the path and the predators; a <em>ḥāzôn</em> provides the light of God's perspective in a world of political "chaos".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>vision (H2377)</strong> is the primary evidence of God's active involvement in human history. It reflects the "integrity" of the prophetic office, where the speaker is merely the conduit for the "Source of Truth". Without this divine "seeing," the people are left to their own "insubordinate" imaginations and lack direction.</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 1</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"The vision (ḥāzôn) of Obadiah..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This opening phrase establishes the authority of the entire book; what follows is a "testimony" from the throne of God.</p></li>
<li><p>It serves as a "divine reality" check for Edom; while they felt secure in their "high habitation," God had already revealed their "downfall" to His prophet.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Samuel 3:1:</strong> "...And the word of the LORD was rare in those days; there was no widespread <strong>vision (ḥāzôn)</strong>."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 89:19:</strong> "Then You spoke in a <strong>vision (ḥāzôn)</strong> to Your holy one..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 29:18:</strong> "Where there is no <strong>revelation (ḥāzôn)</strong>, the people cast off restraint..."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Biblical Context:</strong> The <em>ḥāzôn</em> often came to prophets during times of national "natural pressure points," providing the "sound" guidance needed for survival.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT/Gleanings:</strong> <em>Ḥāzôn</em> represents the "objective" content of revelation; it is not merely a subjective feeling but a "weighty" word from God that must be obeyed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hebrew Culture:</strong> In the ancient world, a prophet's "vision" was considered a "legal report" from the heavenly court, announcing a verdict that was already "faithful" and true.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Functional Truth:</strong> To receive a vision is to be granted "spiritual weight" to see the end of a matter from the beginning, proving that God's "name" and authority are supreme over all nations.</p></li>
