<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>SUBSTANCE — (<em>ḥayil</em>, Strong’s H2428)</strong> Refers to wealth, resources, efficiency, or strength; it describes the "weighty" physical assets and capabilities that sustain a person or nation.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 13</strong>, God indicts Edom for having "laid hands on their <strong>substance</strong> in the day of their calamity". This was a "malicious" act of plunder where Edom "stripped" their brother Jacob of his remaining "wealth" and "saving health" while he was already vulnerable and broken by "chaos".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H2428:</strong> Meaning wealth, virtue, valor, or strength.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>ḥîl</em> (H2342), meaning to "twist" or "whirl," suggesting the firm "strength" found in a twisted rope.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The word carries the idea of "efficiency" and "power"; to take someone’s <em>ḥayil</em> is to "strip" them of their ability to function or defend themselves. It represents the "natural pressure point" where a nation’s "integrity" is maintained by its resources.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Coiled Rope:</strong> Used to describe the "firmness" of a "faithful" man or the "collective power" of an army.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Full Storehouse:</strong> It carries the image of "preeminence" in wealth and "substance" that allows a house to remain at "peace".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a scavenger "stripping" a fallen traveler of his cloak and gold; <strong>substance (H2428)</strong> is the physical "testimony" of one's labor that Edom "maliciously" seized.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>True <strong>substance (H2428)</strong> is a gift from the "Word of the LORD" to those who "walk" in "reverence". When Edom "laid hands" on Israel's substance, they were not just stealing "wealth"; they were "insubordinately" interfering with God’s "divine reality" of discipline. This "integrity gap" ensured that Edom’s own "substance" would be "searched out" and brought to "complete stripping".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 13</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...Nor laid hands on their substance (ḥayil) in the day of their calamity."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah highlights the "cruelty" of the theft; it was committed during Israel’s "calamity," when they were already "empty" of "peace".</p></li>
<li><p>By seizing the <strong>substance</strong>, Edom proved they "despised" their brother and chose "violence" over "saving health".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Exodus 18:21:</strong> "Moreover you shall select from all the people <strong>able (ḥayil)</strong> men, such as fear God..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ruth 4:11:</strong> "...and may you prosper [act with <strong>substance/ḥayil</strong>] in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 31:10:</strong> "Who can find a <strong>virtuous (ḥayil)</strong> wife? For her worth is far above rubies."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To find "soul prosperity," we must recognize that our true <strong>substance</strong> is found in the LORD, not in "empty talk" or "physical wealth". When we "lay hands" on what belongs to another in a time of "chaos," we reveal an "insubordinate" heart that "despises" the "Source of Truth". We must "walk" with "integrity," knowing that those who "strip" others of their "saving health" will eventually be "cut off" and left with "nothing".</p>
