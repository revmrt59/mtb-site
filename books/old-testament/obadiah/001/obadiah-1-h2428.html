<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>FORCES — (<em>ḥayil</em>, Strong’s H2428)</strong> Refers to strength, power, wealth, or an army; it describes the "weighty" resources and capacity of a person or nation.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 11</strong>, the prophet rebukes Edom for standing by while strangers "carried away captive [Israel's] <strong>forces</strong>." This indicates that Israel was being "stripped" of its protection and its "preeminence". Edom watched the "complete destruction" of their brother’s "strength" and resources with "malicious" indifference, failing to offer any "saving health" or support.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H2428:</strong> Meaning strength, might, efficiency, wealth, or an army.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>ḥîl</em>, meaning to "twist" or "whirl" (as in the strength of a rope or the labor of birth).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The root suggests a strength that comes from "firmness" and "integrity". <em>Ḥayil</em> is the "weight" of a nation's ability to defend itself or prosper.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Coiled Rope:</strong> Used to describe strength that is "bound together"; a nation’s <em>ḥayil</em> is its collective "power" and "wealth".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Valiant Warrior:</strong> It carries the image of a "man of valor"—someone who has the "discipline" and "sober" mind to stand in the "chaos" of battle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a treasure chest or a fortified wall; <em>ḥayil</em> is the substance that gives a nation "preeminence" and "security" in the "natural" world.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>True <strong>forces (H2428)</strong> or strength come from the LORD, not merely from physical "wealth" or "mighty men". It reflects the "divine reality" that when a people are "insubordinate" to the "Source of Truth," their <em>ḥayil</em> can be "carried away" in an instant. For Israel, the loss of their <em>ḥayil</em> was a "natural pressure point" designed to bring them back to "reverence" for God.</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 11</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...In the day that strangers carried away captive his forces (ḥayil)..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah uses this term to show the "emptiness" that remained after Jerusalem was plundered; their "wealth" and "warriors" were gone.</p></li>
<li><p>Edom’s crime was watching this "stripping" of their brother’s "integrity" and "power" without intervening, which God viewed as a "malicious" act of "violence".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Exodus 18:21:</strong> "Moreover you shall select from all the people <strong>able (ḥayil)</strong> men, such as fear God..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 18:32:</strong> "It is God who arms me with <strong>strength (ḥayil)</strong>, and makes my way perfect."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 31:10:</strong> "Who can find a <strong>virtuous (ḥayil)</strong> wife? For her worth is far above rubies."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>Real "forces" are found in our "walk" with God. While the world seeks "wealth" and "preeminence" as its <em>ḥayil</em>, the "faithful" find their "strength" in "sound doctrine" and "reverence". To have "soul prosperity" is to have a "virtuous" strength that cannot be "carried away" by the "chaos" of the "nations".</p>
