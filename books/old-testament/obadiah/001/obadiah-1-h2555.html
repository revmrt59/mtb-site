<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>VIOLENCE — (<em>ḥāmās</em>, Strong’s H2555)</strong> Refers to cold-blooded cruelty, injustice, or oppressive wrong; it describes a "malicious" violation of the "integrity" and rights of another.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 10</strong>, God explicitly names the crime: "For <strong>violence</strong> against your brother Jacob, shame shall cover you." This identifies the "integrity gap" that triggered Edom's "destruction"—they did not merely witness Israel's "chaos," they actively participated in the "cruelty" of their downfall.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H2555:</strong> Meaning violence, wrong, cruelty, or injustice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root meaning to "treat violently" or "wrongfully".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The root <em>ḥāmās</em> implies a "violation of law" or "ethical wrong," specifically social injustice and the "malicious" oppression of the weak. It is the "weighty" evidence of an "insubordinate" heart that has rejected the "Source of Truth".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Shattered Border:</strong> Used to describe the "chaos" that occurs when "peace" is replaced by "cruelty," and the "natural pressure points" of life are used to exploit others.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Blood-Stained Hand:</strong> It carries the image of someone who has "stripped" another of their "saving health" and dignity through force or "empty talk".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a garden that has been "laid waste" by a wild beast; <em>ḥāmās</em> is the act of destroying the "order" and "beauty" of the "house of prayer" through "insubordinate" rage.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p><strong>Violence (H2555)</strong> is the antithesis of the "reverent" and "faithful" walk God requires. It reflects the "divine reality" that God will not ignore the "malicious words" or deeds of those who "despise" the "brethren". For Edom, their "violence" was the "testimony" that led to their "shame," proving that those who live by "cruelty" will eventually be "cut off".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 10</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"For violence (ḥāmās) against your brother Jacob..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah adds the word "brother" to emphasize the "spiritual weight" of the sin; Edom's "violence" was a betrayal of family "integrity".</p></li>
<li><p>This "violence" was the reason for the "complete stripping" of Edom's "preeminence," as God reversed their "pride" into "shame".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Genesis 6:11:</strong> "The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with <strong>violence (ḥāmās)</strong>."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 11:5:</strong> "The LORD tests the righteous, but the wicked and the one who loves <strong>violence (ḥāmās)</strong> His soul hates."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 10:6:</strong> "Blessings are on the head of the righteous, but <strong>violence (ḥāmās)</strong> covers the mouth of the wicked."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>Violence begins in a heart that has lost "reverence" for others as "special people". When we allow "malicious" thoughts to fester, we create an "integrity gap" that leads to "chaos" and "destruction". To find "soul prosperity" and "peace," we must reject "violence" in all its forms—including "empty talk"—and "walk" in the "saving health" of God's love.</p>
