<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>SEARCHED — (<em>ḥāpaś</em>, Strong’s H2664)</strong> Refers to a diligent, thorough, and exhaustive search; it carries the idea of "digging" or "stripping" to find what is hidden.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 6</strong>, God asks, "Oh, how Esau shall be <strong>searched</strong> out!" This signifies that no matter how deep the "clefts of the rock" or how "hidden" their treasures, God’s judgment will "strip" away every layer of Edom's "pride" until the "divine reality" of their condition is fully exposed.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H2664:</strong> Meaning to search out, to track, or to strip.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root meaning to "dig for" or to "explore" with great care.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The root <em>ḥāpaś</em> implies a search so intense that it "changes the appearance" of the seeker or the object—like a person in disguise or a room turned upside down to find a lost coin. It is the "weighty" process of uncovering what was meant to remain "private" or "protected".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Miner’s Dig:</strong> Used to describe the act of digging deep into the "earth" to find "hidden treasures" that are not visible on the surface.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Disguised King:</strong> It carries the image of someone trying to "hide" their identity (like Saul at Endor or Ahab in battle), only to have the "Source of Truth" search them out and expose them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a flashlight shining into the darkest corners of a "house of prayer" to find the "chaos" hidden in the shadows; a <em>ḥāpaś</em> leaves no "integrity gap" unaddressed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>Being <strong>searched (H2664)</strong> by God is an act of sovereign "testimony". It reflects the "integrity" of a God who is not satisfied with outward "preeminence" but "searches" the "heart" to see if it is "sound" or "insubordinate". For Edom, this "search" was the "natural pressure point" that proved their "security" was a delusion and their "pride" was their "destruction".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 6</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"Oh, how Esau shall be searched (ḥāpaś) out!..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah uses this term to mock Edom’s "high habitation"; they thought their geography made them "impregnable," but God would "dig" them out like a "hidden treasure".</p></li>
<li><p>This "searching" is the direct response to their "malicious" behavior toward Israel; because they "searched out" ways to hurt their brother, God would "search out" ways to bring them to "shame".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Samuel 23:23:</strong> "...and I will <strong>search (ḥāpaś)</strong> him out among all the thousands of Judah."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 64:6:</strong> "They devise iniquities: 'We have perfected a shrewd <strong>search (ḥāpaś)</strong>.'"</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Zephaniah 1:12:</strong> "And it shall come to pass at that time that I will <strong>search (ḥāpaś)</strong> Jerusalem with lamps..."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To "walk" with the LORD is to invite Him to "search" us daily. When we allow the "Source of Truth" to "search" our "hearts," we find "saving health" and "soul prosperity" because He removes the "chaos" before it leads to "destruction". To be "searched" by grace is "peace"; to be "searched" in "pride" is "complete stripping."</p>
