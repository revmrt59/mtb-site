<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>DISMAYED — (<em>ḥāṯaṯ</em>, Strong’s H2865)</strong> Refers to being shattered, broken, or filled with terror; it describes a state where one's courage and resolve are utterly crushed.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 9</strong>, God declares that the mighty men of Teman shall be <strong>"dismayed."</strong> This is the "divine reality" of Edom's judgment: the very warriors who provided their "preeminence" and security would find their spirits "shattered," leaving them helpless as they are "cut off by slaughter".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H2865:</strong> Meaning to be broken, terrified, or discouraged.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root meaning "to prostrate" or "to break down" by violence or fear.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The root <em>ḥāṯaṯ</em> is often used to describe the "shattering" of a bow or a physical object, but when applied to people, it refers to the "shattering" of the "heart" or "will". It is the "weighty" internal collapse that precedes an external defeat.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Shattered Pot:</strong> Used to describe an object that has been struck so hard it flies into "empty" pieces; it reflects the "chaos" of a mind that can no longer "discern" a way out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Terrified Soldier:</strong> It carries the image of a "mighty man" whose knees knock together in fear, unable to hold his "integrity" or his weapon during a "natural pressure point" of battle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a high stone wall being hit by a wrecking ball; <em>ḥāṯaṯ</em> is the moment the "high habitation" of the ego cracks and falls apart.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>To be <strong>dismayed (H2865)</strong> is the consequence of relying on human "might" rather than the "Source of Truth". It reflects the "integrity" of God’s Word, which warns that those who "walk" in "insubordinate" pride will eventually be "broken". For the "faithful," God commands "Do not be dismayed," providing "peace" and "saving health"; but for the "malicious," dismay is the "testimony" of their coming "destruction".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 9</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"Then your mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed (ḥāṯaṯ)..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah targets the "mighty men"—the elite "special people" of Edom’s defense—to show that no level of human "strength" can prevent God's "complete stripping" of a nation.</p></li>
<li><p>Their "dismay" is the "divine reality" check that proves their "wisdom" and "understanding" were "empty talk" in the face of the LORD's judgment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Joshua 1:9:</strong> "...Do not be afraid, nor be <strong>dismayed (ḥāṯaṯ)</strong>, for the LORD your God is with you..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Samuel 2:10:</strong> "The adversaries of the LORD shall be <strong>broken (ḥāṯaṯ)</strong> in pieces..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isaiah 8:9:</strong> "...Gird yourselves, but be <strong>broken (ḥāṯaṯ)</strong> in pieces..."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>Dismay is the "spiritual weight" of realizing one's own "emptiness" without God. To avoid being "shattered" by the "chaos" of life, we must "walk" in "reverence" and "faithfulness," anchoring our "integrity" in the "Source of Truth". When we find our "soul prosperity" in the LORD, we can face any "natural pressure point" with "peace" rather than being "dismayed".</p>
