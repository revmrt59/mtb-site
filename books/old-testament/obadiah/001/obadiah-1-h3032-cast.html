<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>CAST — (<em>yāḏâ</em>, Strong’s H3032)</strong> Refers to the act of throwing, shooting, or hurling; it implies a decisive physical action to move an object from one place to another.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 11</strong>, the foreigners "<strong>cast</strong> lots for Jerusalem." This verb exposes the "insubordinate" and "malicious" nature of the invaders; they "threw" the fate of God's city as if it were of no "weight" or value, treating the "beloved" dwelling of God with "violence" and contempt.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H3032:</strong> Meaning to cast, shoot, or throw.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root describing the motion of the hand to project an object.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Note:</strong> This is distinct from <em>yāḏâ</em> (H3034), which means to confess or praise, though both involve the use of the "hand" (<em>yāḏ</em>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Archer’s Arrow:</strong> Used to describe shooting arrows; it reflects a "targeted" action with a specific "testimony" or result.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Stoning of a Criminal:</strong> It carries the image of "casting" stones in judgment; here in Obadiah, the "foreigners" are "casting" for Jerusalem as if they were the ones in "preeminence".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a hand "emptying" its contents; to <strong>cast (H3032)</strong> is to release control of an object into the "chaos" of the moment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Insight</strong></p>
<p>What we "cast" with our hands reveals the "integrity" of our hearts. When the "nations" cast lots for Jerusalem, they were "throwing" away their own "saving health" by attacking God’s "special people". We must be "sober" and "temperate," ensuring our actions "shoot" toward the "Word of the LORD" rather than toward the "destruction" of our neighbor.</p>
