<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>CAST LOTS — (<em>yāḏâ gôrāl</em>, Strong’s H3032 / H1486)</strong> Refers to the practice of throwing stones or pebbles to make a decision or distribute property by chance.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 11</strong>, the foreigners "entered [Jerusalem's] gates and <strong>cast lots</strong> for Jerusalem." This represents the ultimate indignity: the holy city of God was treated as common "plunder," with its fate and its people’s lives decided by a game of "chance" among "malicious" enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H3032 (<em>yāḏâ</em>):</strong> To throw, cast, or shoot.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H1486 (<em>gôrāl</em>):</strong> A small stone used for lot-casting; figuratively, one’s "allotted" portion or destiny.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> While Israel used lots to discern God’s "order" (as in the division of the Land), the "nations" used them as a "natural pressure point" to divide "spoils" with total disregard for the victims.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Division of Spoils:</strong> Used to describe how soldiers would divide "wealth" or captives after a battle—treating human lives as mere "merchandise".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Hand of Providence:</strong> Proverbially, the "lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD" (Prov 16:33). For Edom and the foreigners, they thought they were in control of the "chaos," but the "divine reality" was that God was recording their "evil deeds".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of dice rolling on a table while a house is burning; it reflects a "cold-blooded" and "insubordinate" indifference to the suffering of others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>cast lots (H3032/H1486)</strong> for God’s "special people" is a direct affront to the LORD. It reflects an "integrity gap" where the "nations" believe they can determine the "destiny" of Zion by "chance". In Obadiah, this act is the "testimony" that seals Edom's "shame"—because they watched and participated in this "malicious" game, their own "inheritance" would be "searched out" and taken away.</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 11</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...And foreigners entered his gates and cast lots (gôrāl) for Jerusalem..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah highlights the "chaos" and the "stripping" of the city; Jerusalem was no longer seen as the "house of prayer" but as a prize to be "thrown" for.</p></li>
<li><p>Edom’s "violence" was solidified in this moment; by standing by while the "lots" were cast, they effectively "cast" their own "walk" with the "strangers" rather than with their brother.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 22:18:</strong> "They divide My garments among them, and for My clothing they <strong>cast lots (gôrāl)</strong>." (A Messianic prophecy of ultimate "shame" and "stripping").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Joel 3:3:</strong> "They have <strong>cast lots (gôrāl)</strong> for My people, have given a boy as payment for a harlot..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nahum 3:10:</strong> "...They <strong>cast lots (gôrāl)</strong> for her honorable men, and all her great men were bound in chains."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>The world may try to "cast lots" for our "peace" or our "testimony," but our "destiny" is not a matter of "chance". When we "walk" in "reverence" and "faithfulness," we know that our "allotted portion" is held by the LORD. To avoid the "chaos" of the "nations," we must anchor our "integrity" in God's "Word," trusting that He will restore our "saving health" even when the world tries to "divide" our lives.</p>
