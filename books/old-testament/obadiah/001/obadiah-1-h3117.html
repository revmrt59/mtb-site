<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>DAY OF THE LORD — (<em>yôm yehōwâ</em>, Strong’s H3117 / H3068)</strong> A "weighty" biblical theme describing a time of God’s decisive intervention to judge "wickedness" and restore "integrity" to the earth. It is the "Source of Truth" breaking through human "chaos" to settle all accounts.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 15</strong>, it is the "reprisal" for Edom's "malicious" walk; but across the Old Testament, it is the ultimate "testimony" of God’s "preeminence" over the "nations" and His "saving health" for the "faithful".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H3117 (<em>yôm</em>):</strong> Meaning a day, a specific time, or a season.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H3068 (<em>yehōwâ</em>):</strong> The proper name of the God of Israel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The term represents a "pivotal" moment where the "natural" world is confronted by the "divine reality" of God's presence.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Biblical Profile and Significance</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prophetic Development: A Growing Weight</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Judgment of Nations:</strong> Prophets like Isaiah and Zephaniah describe the Day as a "complete stripping" of the "pride" of the world. It is "cruel, with both wrath and fierce anger" for those who are "insubordinate" (Isa 13:9).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Refiner’s Fire:</strong> Malachi presents the Day as a "natural pressure point" for the priesthood and the "special people," asking, "Who can endure the day of His coming?" (Mal 3:2).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Valley of Decision:</strong> Joel sees the Day as a time of "multitudes" in the valley where the "Word of the LORD" roars from Zion, bringing "chaos" to the sun and moon but "peace" to His people (Joel 3:14-16).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The "Two-Sided" Reality: Sifting the Heart</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The "Bad" Side (For the Malicious):</strong> It is a day of "shame," "destruction," and being "cut off". For those who "despised" their "brethren," the Day is "darkness, and not light" (Amos 5:18).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The "Good" Side (For the Faithful):</strong> It is a day of "deliverance" and "saving health". On "Mount Zion," there shall be "holiness," and the "house of Jacob" shall finally find "soul prosperity" (Obad 17).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Final "Order": The Kingdom of God</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Day of the LORD is the "safe voyage" into the Messianic age. It concludes with the "divine reality" that "the kingdom shall be the LORD’S" (Obad 21).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Insight</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Day of the LORD</strong> is the "integrity gap" closer. It proves that no "empty talk" or "violence" goes unnoticed by the "Source of Truth". To "walk" in "reverence" today is to prepare for "peace" tomorrow. For the "faithful," this Day is not a terror to avoid, but a "saving health" to anticipate, as it marks the end of "chaos" and the beginning of God's eternal "preeminence".</p>
