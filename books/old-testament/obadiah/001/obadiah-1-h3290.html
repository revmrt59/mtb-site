<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>JACOB — (<em>ya‘ăqōḇ</em>, Strong’s H3290)</strong> The name means <strong>"heel-catcher"</strong> or <strong>"supplanter."</strong> He was the younger twin brother of Esau and the patriarch from whom the twelve tribes of Israel descended.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 10</strong>, God rebukes Edom for violence against <strong>"your brother Jacob."</strong> This phrasing highlights the "spiritual weight" of the conflict—it wasn't just a political war, but a betrayal of a "covenant" family bond. While Jacob represents the "special people" chosen by grace, his name here also recalls the "natural pressure point" of his own history of struggle and restoration.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H3290:</strong> Meaning "heel-catcher" or "supplanter".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>‘āqaḇ</em> (to seize the heel, to circumvent, or to overreach).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The name reflects Jacob's birth, where he grabbed Esau’s heel (Gen 25:26), symbolizing a "walk" that was initially characterized by "shrewdness" and "empty talk" before he was transformed by God.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Biblical Profile and Significance</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transformation: From Supplanter to Prince</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Jacob’s life is a "testimony" of God’s ability to take a "deceptive" heart and bring it into "integrity".</p></li>
<li><p>After wrestling with God at Peniel, his name was changed to <strong>Israel</strong> ("Prince with God"), marking a shift from relying on his own "preeminence" to relying on the "Source of Truth".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Covenant: The Chosen Remnant</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Despite his flaws, Jacob was the "beloved" of God—not because of his "shrewdness," but because of God’s sovereign choice (Mal 1:2-3).</p></li>
<li><p>In Obadiah, "Jacob" refers to the whole nation of Israel, the "house of prayer" that God intends to restore while bringing "destruction" to those who sought their "chaos".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Symbolism: The Spirit vs. The Flesh</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Jacob and Esau represent the perpetual struggle between the "spiritual man" and the "natural man".</p></li>
<li><p>While Esau (Edom) is "insubordinate" and "malicious," Jacob (Israel) is the vessel for "saving health" and the Messianic line.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Inheritance: The Possession of Zion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah concludes with the promise that the "house of Jacob" shall possess their possessions (v. 17).</p></li>
<li><p>This "divine reality" ensures that no "violence" or "shame" inflicted by the world can permanently "cut off" those who are "faithful" to the LORD.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Insight</strong></p>
<p>"Jacob" is a reminder that our "walk" may start with "stumbling" and "deception," but through "reverence" for God, we can be transformed into "special people". When we face the "violence" of the world, we can have "peace" knowing that our "integrity" is guarded by the One who chose us. To be part of the "house of Jacob" is to find "soul prosperity" even in the midst of "natural pressure points".</p>
