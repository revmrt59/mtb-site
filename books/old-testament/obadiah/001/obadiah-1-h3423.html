<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>POSSESS — (<em>yāraš</em>, Strong’s H3423)</strong> Refers to taking possession of, inheriting, or dispossessing a previous inhabitant; it describes the "weighty" transition of authority and ownership.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 17</strong>, God promises that "the house of Jacob shall <strong>possess</strong> their possessions". This is the "divine reality" of restoration: the nation that was "stripped" and "disdained" by Edom would now be empowered by the "Word of the LORD" to reclaim their "inheritance" and "preeminence".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H3423:</strong> Meaning to occupy (by driving out previous tenants), to inherit, or to come into possession.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root emphasizing the act of seizing or succeeding to an estate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The term carries the idea of "legal right" and "divine appointment". To <strong>possess (H3423)</strong> is to occupy the space God has "allotted" for one's "safe habitation" and "integrity".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The New Tenant:</strong> Used to describe an heir taking over the "house" and "wealth" of a father; it reflects a "faithful" continuity of the family line.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Dispossessed Enemy:</strong> It often carries the "natural pressure point" of warfare, where the "insubordinate" are driven out so the "special people" can dwell in "peace".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a field being cleared of thorns to plant wheat; to <strong>possess</strong> is to remove the "chaos" to make room for "soul prosperity".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p><strong>Possess (H3423)</strong> is the "testimony" of God’s covenant "faithfulness". It reflects the "integrity" of God's promise: those who were "delivered up" to their enemies will eventually "dispossess" those who "maliciously" exploited them. While Edom tried to "possess" the lands of Jacob through "violence," the "divine reality" is that Jacob will "possess" the mountains of Esau.</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 17</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...The house of Jacob shall possess (yāraš) their possessions."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah uses a wordplay here; Jacob will not just "have" things, they will "inherit" back what was "maliciously" taken.</p></li>
<li><p>This "possessing" is the "saving health" of a nation restored to its "proper order" and "preeminence" under the LORD.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Genesis 15:7:</strong> "I am the LORD... to give you this land to <strong>inherit (yāraš)</strong> it."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Numbers 33:53:</strong> "You shall <strong>dispossess (yāraš)</strong> the inhabitants of the land and dwell in it..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 37:11:</strong> "But the meek shall <strong>inherit (yāraš)</strong> the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To truly <strong>possess</strong> our "inheritance" in God, we must "walk" in "reverence" and "integrity". When we seek to "possess" things through "empty talk" or "violence," we only invite "chaos" and "complete destruction". True "soul prosperity" is found when we allow the LORD to "search out" our hearts and lead us into the "saving health" of His "kingdom".</p>
