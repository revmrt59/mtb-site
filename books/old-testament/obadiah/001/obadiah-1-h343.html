<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>CALAMITY — (<em>’êḏ</em>, Strong’s H343)</strong> Refers to a heavy burden, disaster, or a crushing misfortune that brings a person or nation to the brink of "destruction".</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 13</strong>, the term is used three times to emphasize the "weight" of Israel’s suffering. God rebukes Edom for entering the gate, gazing on affliction, and laying hands on substance "in the day of their <strong>calamity</strong>". This "natural pressure point" was intended by God as discipline, but Edom used the "chaos" as an opportunity for "malicious" profit.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H343:</strong> Meaning distress, burden, or disaster.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Likely derived from an unused root meaning "to load" or "to oppress," suggesting a "weighty" disaster that bears down on a victim.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The word often refers to a "final" or "pivotal" disaster—a "day of calamity" that tests the "integrity" of everyone watching. It is the opposite of "peace" and "saving health".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Heavy Burden:</strong> Used to describe a load that is too great for a traveler to carry; it reflects the "shame" and "exhaustion" of a nation under judgment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Gathering Storm:</strong> It carries the image of a sudden "cloud" or "mist" that brings "chaos" and darkness, stripping away the "preeminence" of the day.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a building collapsing; <strong>calamity (H343)</strong> is the moment the "high habitation" falls, leaving the residents "empty" and exposed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>calamity (H343)</strong> is a "divine reality" used to "search out" the hearts of men. While Israel faced "calamity" for their "insubordinate" walk, Edom’s reaction to that calamity became their own "testimony" of "wickedness". God warns that those who "rejoice" in another's calamity will not go unpunished, as it shows a total lack of "reverence" for the "brethren".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 13</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...In the day of their calamity (‘êḏ). Indeed, you should not have gazed on their affliction in the day of their calamity (‘êḏ), nor laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity (‘êḏ)."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The repetition of "calamity" serves as a "weighty" indictment against Edom’s "malicious" timing.</p></li>
<li><p>Edom treated the "special people" of God as "spoils" during their "natural pressure point," proving they had no "faithful" love for their "brother".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Deuteronomy 32:35:</strong> "...For the day of their <strong>calamity (‘êḏ)</strong> is at hand, and the things to come hasten upon them."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Job 31:23:</strong> "For <strong>destruction (‘êḏ)</strong> from God is a terror to me..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 17:5:</strong> "...He who is glad at <strong>calamity (‘êḏ)</strong> will not go unpunished."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To have "soul prosperity," we must not find "peace" in another’s <strong>calamity</strong>. When we see others under a "weighty" burden, our "walk" should be one of "saving health" and support rather than "empty talk" or "violence". To exploit a brother’s "chaos" is to create an "integrity gap" that eventually brings "complete stripping" upon our own "house".</p>
