<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>SAVIORS — (<em>yāša‘</em>, Strong’s H3467)</strong> Refers to those who bring help, deliverance, or salvation; it describes individuals empowered to rescue others from "distress" and "chaos".</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 21</strong>, the prophecy concludes with <strong>"saviors"</strong> coming to Mount Zion to judge the mountains of Esau. This is the "divine reality" of a "safe voyage" into the final "order" of the "kingdom". While Edom "maliciously" acted as a "trapper" to "cut off" survivors, God provides "saviors" to restore "saving health" and "preeminence" to His "special people".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H3467:</strong> Meaning to save, be delivered, or be victorious.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root meaning to be "open," "wide," or "free"; it is the opposite of being in a "tight place" or "distress".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The word carries the "weighty" sense of moving from a state of "confinement" to a "wide place" of "peace" and "integrity".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Wide Open Field:</strong> Used to describe a person who has been "delivered" from a "natural pressure point" into a space where they can "walk" freely.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Victorious Leader:</strong> It carries the image of "judges" or "mighty men" raised up by the "Word of the LORD" to end the "shame" of the nation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a rescuer breaking a lock to set a prisoner free; <strong>saviors (H3467)</strong> are the instruments of God’s "deliverance" who "strip" the enemy of their power.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>True <strong>saviors (H3467)</strong> are a "testimony" of God’s "faithfulness" to His covenant. While the "nations" relied on "empty talk" and "violence," God’s "saviors" operate with "holiness" to restore the "sanctity" of Mount Zion. This "divine reality" ensures that the "integrity gap" caused by Edom’s "pride" is settled by those who "walk" in the "order" of the LORD.</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 21</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"Then saviors (yāša‘) shall come to Mount Zion to judge the mountains of Esau..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah uses this word to show that the "Day of the LORD" results in an active and "sound" government.</p></li>
<li><p>These "saviors" do not just "deliver" Jacob; they execute "judgment" on the "house of Esau," proving that God's "saving health" is inseparable from His "justice".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Judges 3:9:</strong> "...the LORD raised up a <strong>deliverer [savior] (yāša‘)</strong> for the children of Israel, who delivered them..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 20:6:</strong> "Now I know that the LORD <strong>saves (yāša‘)</strong> His anointed..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isaiah 19:20:</strong> "...He will send them a <strong>Savior (yāša‘)</strong> and a Great One, and He will deliver them."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To find "soul prosperity," we must look to the LORD as the ultimate "Source of Truth" and the one who sends <strong>saviors</strong>. When we are "cut off" by the "chaos" of this world, we can trust in the "saving health" of His "Word" to "deliver" us from "distress". True "integrity" is found in "reverence" for the "kingdom," knowing that God will "search out" and "deliver" all who remain "faithful" and "sober" in their "walk".</p>
