<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>CANAANITES — (<em>kĕna‘ănî</em>, Strong’s H3669)</strong> The original inhabitants of the land promised to Abraham; they represent the "insubordinate" culture of "idolatry" and "wickedness" that Israel was commanded to dispossess.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 20</strong>, the "captives" of Israel are promised that they shall "possess the land of the <strong>Canaanites</strong> as far as Zarephath". This is a "weighty" decree of restoration: the "special people" who were "stripped" of their own "habitation" will return to "possess" the very regions that once defined the "chaos" of the "nations".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H3669:</strong> Meaning a descendant of Canaan, or a "merchant/trafficker".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>kāna‘</em> (H3665), meaning to be "humbled," "subdued," or "brought low".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The name reflects the "divine reality" of their history—a people who were "brought low" because of their "violence" and "pride".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Biblical Profile and Significance</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Culture of Commerce and Chaos: Merchants of Pride</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>Canaanites</strong> were known for their "preeminence" in trade and "empty talk," often valuing "substance" and "wealth" over "integrity".</p></li>
<li><p>Their "walk" was characterized by "malicious" practices that "despised" the "sanctity" of life, eventually leading to their "complete stripping" by the "Word of the LORD".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Promised Possession: Restoring the Order</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah declares that the "captives" shall "possess" their land.</p></li>
<li><p>This represents the "pivotal" reversal where those once "humbled" by exile now "subdue" the land of those who were "humbled" by judgment.</p></li>
<li><p>It signifies a return to the "order" of the "kingdom," where the "saving health" of Zion replaces the "shame" of the Canaanite "habitation".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Boundary of Zarephath: A Final Testimony</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The possession extends to "Zarephath," emphasizing a "safe voyage" of restoration that covers the full "weight" of the original promise.</p></li>
<li><p>It proves that God is "faithful" to "search out" and restore every "remnant" of His people's "inheritance".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Insight</strong></p>
<p>The profile of the <strong>Canaanites</strong> reminds us that "preeminence" built on "wickedness" will eventually be "brought low". To find "soul prosperity," we must "walk" in "reverence" rather than "idolatry" or "empty talk". When we feel like "captives" in a "chaos" of our own making, we can trust that a return to "integrity" will lead to a "safe habitation" and the "peace" of our true "possessions".</p>
