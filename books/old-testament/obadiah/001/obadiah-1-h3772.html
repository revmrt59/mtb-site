<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>CUT OFF — (<em>kāraṯ</em>, Strong’s H3772)</strong> Refers to being severed, eliminated, or destroyed; it often implies the formal breaking of a covenant or the removal of a person or nation from existence.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 10</strong>, the finality of Edom's sentence is pronounced: "You shall be <strong>cut off</strong> forever." This is the "divine reality" of a judgment that leaves no "remnant". Because Edom sought to "cut off" the fugitives of Israel, they themselves would experience a "complete stripping" of their national life and "preeminence".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H3772:</strong> Meaning to cut, to sever, or to make a covenant.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root describing a physical "cutting" action.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The word <em>kāraṯ</em> is used both for "cutting a covenant" (<em>bĕrît</em>) and for "cutting off" those who break it. This highlights the "integrity" of God's law: the same "weighty" decree that binds the "faithful" to God's "peace" will "sever" those who are "insubordinate" and "malicious".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Felled Tree:</strong> Used to describe the act of "cutting down" a tree so it can no longer grow or bear fruit—it reflects a "destruction" that is final.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Severed Branch:</strong> It carries the image of a branch being removed from its source of "saving health," leading to immediate "chaos" and eventual death.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a life-line being "cut" during a storm; to be <em>kāraṯ</em> is to lose the "safe voyage" and be lost to the "natural pressure points" of the world forever.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>To be <strong>cut off (H3772)</strong> is the ultimate "testimony" of God's holiness. It reflects the "integrity gap" that occurs when a soul or nation "despises" the "Source of Truth" for so long that they are "severed" from His mercy. For Edom, being "cut off forever" meant the end of their "house" and "reputation," contrasting with the "house of Jacob" which would be restored.</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 10</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...And you shall be cut off (kāraṯ) forever."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah pairs this with "shame" to show that Edom's "walk" has reached a dead end.</p></li>
<li><p>While other nations might face a "natural pressure point" and recover, Edom's "violence" was so "malicious" that their judgment is "eternal" and "unrelenting".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Genesis 17:14:</strong> "...that person shall be <strong>cut off (kāraṯ)</strong> from his people; he has broken My covenant."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exodus 12:15:</strong> "...that soul shall be <strong>cut off (kāraṯ)</strong> from Israel."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 37:9:</strong> "For evildoers shall be <strong>cut off (kāraṯ)</strong>; but those who wait on the LORD, they shall inherit the earth."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To avoid being "cut off," we must remain "grafted" into the "Source of Truth" through "faithfulness" and "reverence". When we "walk" in the "saving health" of God's Word, we find "peace" and a "soul prosperity" that can never be "severed". To choose the "empty talk" of "pride" is to pick up the very knife that will "cut" us away from the life we desire.</p>
