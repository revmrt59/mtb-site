<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>HEART — (<em>lēḇ</em>, Strong’s H3824)</strong> Refers to the inner man, including the mind, will, emotions, and the seat of moral character.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 3</strong>, the prophet exposes the root of Edom’s rebellion: "The pride of your <strong>heart</strong> has deceived you." This indicates that their "insubordinate" behavior was not a strategic error but a deep-seated spiritual issue, where the "center" of their being had become disconnected from the "Source of Truth".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H3824:</strong> Meaning the heart, soul, or inner self.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A very common word in the Old Testament, representing the "control center" of human life.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The <em>lēḇ</em> is the place where a person "thinks," "plans," and "decides". It is not merely the seat of emotions but the seat of the "will," meaning that what happens in the "heart" eventually determines the direction of one's "walk".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Hidden Well:</strong> Used to describe the "unseen" part of a person that contains their true motives and "integrity".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Pilot’s Wheel:</strong> It carries the image of the instrument that steers the "journey" of a life; if the heart is "hardened," the entire vessel moves toward "chaos".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of the foundation of a building; if the "heart" is stable and "reverent," the life can withstand "natural pressure points," but if it is full of "pride," the whole structure will collapse.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>heart (H3824)</strong> is the primary focus of God’s judgment and "saving health". It reflects the "divine reality" that God does not look at the "high habitation" or outward "preeminence" but at the "spiritual weight" of the inner man. A "prosperous soul" begins with a heart that is "sound" and "temperate," free from the "malicious" intent that leads to "destruction".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 3</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"The pride of your heart (lēḇ) has deceived you..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This identifies the heart as the "origin point" of Edom's "deception"; they lied to themselves in the "quietness" of their own minds before they ever acted against Israel.</p></li>
<li><p>Because their heart was "arrogant," they could not see the "truth" of their situation, proving that an "insubordinate" heart is its own worst enemy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Deuteronomy 6:5:</strong> "You shall love the LORD your God with all your <strong>heart (lēḇ)</strong>, with all your soul..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Samuel 16:7:</strong> "...For the LORD does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the <strong>heart (lēḇ)</strong>."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 4:23:</strong> "Keep your <strong>heart (lēḇ)</strong> with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>Our "walk" is always a reflection of our "heart." To find "peace" and "soul prosperity," we must ensure that our inner man is "nourishing" itself on the "Source of Truth" rather than the "empty talk" of the world. When our heart is "reverent" and "faithful," we can navigate the "chaos" of life with "integrity" and "saving health".</p>
