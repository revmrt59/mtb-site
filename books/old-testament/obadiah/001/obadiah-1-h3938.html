<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>SWALLOW — (<em>lā‘a</em>, Strong’s H3938)</strong> Refers to the act of gulping down or devouring greedily; it describes a "weighty" and total consumption.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 16</strong>, God declares that the nations shall "drink and <strong>swallow</strong>." This is the "divine reality" of judgment: the nations that "greedily" sought the "chaos" and "destruction" of Jerusalem would now be forced to "swallow" the full measure of their own "malicious" actions until they are "as though they had never been."</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H3938:</strong> Meaning to swallow down, gulp, or devour.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root describing the physical action of swallowing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The word carries the idea of being "engulfed" or "lost" within something; to <strong>swallow (H3938)</strong> the cup of judgment is to be completely overwhelmed by its "weight."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Gulping Drunkard:</strong> Used to describe someone drinking in "insubordinate" haste, losing all "sober" discipline.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Devouring Earth:</strong> It carries the image of a "breach" or a pit that "swallows" those who walk in "wickedness," leaving no "remnant".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a whirlpool that "swallows" a vessel; the <strong>swallow (H3938)</strong> represents the point of "no return" where a nation’s "preeminence" is lost to the "chaos."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>swallow (H3938)</strong> the judgment of God is the ultimate "testimony" of the "integrity" of His Word. For Edom and the "nations," who "swallowed" Israel's "substance" with "malicious" intent, the "divine reality" is that they must now "swallow" the very "destruction" they poured out. This "complete stripping" ensures that "insubordinate" pride is totally removed from the "holy mountain."</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 16</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...Yes, they shall drink, and swallow (lā‘a), and they shall be as though they had never been."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah uses this word to emphasize the <strong>finality</strong> of the judgment; the nations don't just "taste" the cup, they "swallow" it entirely.</p></li>
<li><p>This "swallowing" leads to a state where their "house" and "reputation" are "cut off" forever.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Job 6:3:</strong> "...Therefore my words have been <strong>rash [swallowed] (lā‘a)</strong>." (Describing words spoken in "anguish" and "distress").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 20:25:</strong> "It is a snare for a man to <strong>devour [swallow] (lā‘a)</strong> that which is holy..." (A warning against "insubordinate" use of sacred things).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To have "soul prosperity," we must not "swallow" the "empty talk" or "malicious" desires of the world. When we "greedily" participate in the "chaos" of the "nations," we invite a "natural pressure point" that will eventually "swallow" our own "peace." We must "walk" in "reverence" and "integrity," drinking only the "saving health" of the "Word of the LORD," so that we are never "devoured" by judgment.</p>
