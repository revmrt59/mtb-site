<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>POSSESSIONS — (<em>môrāš</em>, Strong’s H4181)</strong> Refers to an inheritance, a legacy, or a physical heritage; it describes the specific "weighty" property and territory that belongs to a person or people by divine right.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 17</strong>, the promise that "the house of Jacob shall possess their <strong>possessions</strong>" serves as the "divine reality" of a complete restoration. While Edom "maliciously" treated Israel’s land as "plunder" and "spoils," God declares that the "special people" will reclaim the "integrity" of their "safe habitation" and national "preeminence".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H4181:</strong> Meaning a possession, inheritance, or heritage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>yāraš</em> (H3423), the verb meaning to occupy or inherit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The word emphasizes the <em>result</em> of the inheritance—the actual "substance" and land that provides "peace" and "soul prosperity" for the family line.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Ancestral Land:</strong> Used to describe the territory "allotted" to a tribe; it is the physical "testimony" of God’s covenant "faithfulness".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Recovered Estate:</strong> It carries the image of a "remnant" returning to their "house" after it was "stripped" by "foreigners," reclaiming the "sanctity" of their home.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a boundary marker being reset after a season of "chaos"; <strong>possessions (H4181)</strong> are the "sound" and "faithful" boundaries restored by the "Word of the LORD".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p><strong>Possessions (H4181)</strong> are the physical evidence of being "faithful" to the "Source of Truth". For the "insubordinate," their possessions are "searched out" and taken away, but for the "house of Jacob," their <strong>possessions</strong> are a "saving health" that God protects. This "divine reality" ensures that no "malicious" act by the "nations" can permanently "cut off" the inheritance of those who "walk" in "reverence".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 17</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...The house of Jacob shall possess their possessions (môrāš)."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah pairs the verb and noun to show the "completeness" of the reversal; those who were "dispossessed" now "possess" the very thing they lost.</p></li>
<li><p>This restoration is the "testimony" that God’s "order" prevails over the "violence" and "shame" inflicted by Edom.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Exodus 6:8:</strong> "...and I will give it to you as a <strong>heritage (môrāš)</strong>: I am the LORD."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deuteronomy 33:4:</strong> "Moses commanded us a law, a <strong>heritage (môrāš)</strong> of the congregation of Jacob."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ezekiel 11:15:</strong> "...unto us this land is given in <strong>possession (môrāš)</strong>."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To find "soul prosperity," we must recognize that our true <strong>possessions</strong> are anchored in the "Word of the LORD". When we "walk" in "integrity," we can have "peace" knowing that our "inheritance" is not subject to the "chaos" of the world. While the "malicious" seek to "strip" others, the "faithful" remain "sober" and "temperate," trusting that God will ensure they "possess" the "saving health" of His "kingdom".</p>
