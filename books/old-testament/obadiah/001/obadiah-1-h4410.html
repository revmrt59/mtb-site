<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>KINGDOM — (<em>mĕlûkâ</em>, Strong’s H4410)</strong> Refers to kingship, royal power, or the office of a king; it describes the "weighty" reality of sovereign rule and "preeminence".</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 21</strong>, the prophecy concludes with the ultimate "testimony": <strong>"And the kingdom shall be the LORD’S."</strong> This is the final "order" that settles all "chaos." While the "nations" and the "house of Esau" walked in "insubordinate" pride, seeking to establish their own "high habitations," the "divine reality" is that all human authority is "stripped" away, leaving only the "integrity" and "peace" of God's eternal reign.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H4410:</strong> Meaning kingship, royalty, or a kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>mālak</em> (H4427), meaning to reign, to be king, or to take counsel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The word identifies the "Source of Truth" in governance—the exercise of "reverence" and "justice" over a "special people" and their "habitation".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Royal Scepter:</strong> Used to describe the power of a king to "search out" a matter and provide "saving health" for his subjects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Dominion of the Land:</strong> It carries the image of a "safe voyage" into a land where the "Word of the LORD" is the law, replacing the "empty talk" and "violence" of the "nations".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a vast city where the light of the King reaches every corner, "completely stripping" the darkness of its power; the <strong>kingdom (H4410)</strong> is the final state of "soul prosperity".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>The declaration that the <strong>kingdom (H4410)</strong> belongs to the LORD is the "pivotal" shift of the Bible. It proves that the "natural pressure point" of history is moving toward God’s "preeminence". For Edom, who "despised" God’s "sanctity," the kingdom is a day of "judgment"; for the "remnant," it is a day of "deliverance" and "holiness".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 21</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...to judge the mountains of Esau; and the kingdom (mĕlûkâ) shall be the LORD’S."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah ends with a "testimony" of hope; the "shame" of exile and the "distress" of the "house of Jacob" are swallowed up by the "divine reality" of God’s rule.</p></li>
<li><p>This "integrity" of the LORD’S reign is the final answer to the "malicious" actions of the "house of Esau".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Samuel 10:16:</strong> "...But about the matter of the <strong>kingdom (mĕlûkâ)</strong>, of which Samuel had spoken, he did not tell him."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 22:28:</strong> "For the <strong>kingdom (mĕlûkâ)</strong> is the LORD’S, and He rules over the nations."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Zechariah 14:9:</strong> "And the LORD shall be King over all the earth. In that day it shall be—'The LORD is one,' and His name one.".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To find "soul prosperity" today, we must choose to live under the <strong>kingdom</strong> of the LORD now. When we "walk" in "integrity" and "reverence," we align ourselves with the "Source of Truth" rather than the "chaos" of the world. Let us remain "faithful" and "sober," knowing that every "calamity" is a "natural pressure point" leading us toward the "saving health" of His eternal "order," where "the kingdom shall be the LORD’S".</p>
