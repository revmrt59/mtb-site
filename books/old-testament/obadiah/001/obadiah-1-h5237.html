<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>FOREIGNERS — (<em>nokrî</em>, Strong’s H5237)</strong> Refers to someone from a different country, culture, or lineage; it emphasizes being "unfamiliar" or "alien" to the household of Israel.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 11</strong>, the prophet notes that <strong>"foreigners"</strong> entered Jerusalem’s gates. This adds to the "shame" of Edom’s conduct: while actual "outsiders" with no family ties were plundering the "special people" of God, Edom—who was family—acted with the same "malicious" detachment as these "alien" invaders.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H5237:</strong> Meaning foreign, alien, or unknown.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>nēḵār</em> (foreignness) and related to <em>nāḵar</em> (to recognize, or to treat as a stranger).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The word carries a "neutral" to "negative" connotation; it refers to that which is "not of the same spirit" or "order". A <em>nokrî</em> is someone whose "walk" and "testimony" are entirely distinct from the "Source of Truth" found in Israel.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Unknown Traveler:</strong> Used to describe someone who passes through but has no "integrity" or stake in the community’s "peace".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Strange God:</strong> It carries the image of "foreign" idols that bring "chaos" to the "house of prayer" by drawing hearts away from the LORD.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a padlock on a gate being broken by a "strange" hand; the <em>nokrî</em> represents the "natural pressure point" of invasion where the "sanctity" of the home is violated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>The entry of <strong>foreigners (H5237)</strong> into the gates of the "beloved" city was a sign of divine judgment. It reflected the "divine reality" that when God's people become "insubordinate," He allows those who do not "know" Him to "strip" away their "preeminence". For Edom, to behave like a <em>nokrî</em> toward their "brother" was a rejection of their own "covenant" history.</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 11</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...And foreigners (nokrîm) entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah highlights the "chaos" of the scene: "foreigners" treating the holy city like a common prize of war.</p></li>
<li><p>Edom’s "integrity gap" is exposed here: they were "Jacob’s brother" (v. 10), yet they chose to be "as one of them" (v. 11), aligning their "walk" with the "malicious" foreigners rather than their own kin.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Exodus 21:8:</strong> "...he shall have no power to sell her to a <strong>foreign (nokrî)</strong> people..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Kings 11:1:</strong> "But King Solomon loved many <strong>foreign (nokrî)</strong> women..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 69:8:</strong> "I have become a stranger to my brothers, and a <strong>foreigner (nokrî)</strong> to my mother’s children." (A prophetic echo of Israel’s pain)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To be a "foreigner" is more than a matter of geography; it is a matter of the "heart." We can live in the "house of prayer" and still be a "stranger" to the "Source of Truth" if our "walk" is "insubordinate". To find "soul prosperity" and "saving health," we must ensure we are not "foreign" to God's "peace," but "faithful" residents of His kingdom.</p>
