<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>DECEIVED — (<em>nāšā’</em>, Strong’s H5377)</strong> Refers to being led astray, deluded, or mentally seduced into believing something that is false.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 3</strong>, God reveals that Edom’s own heart has <strong>"deceived"</strong> them. This is the tragic "divine reality" of pride: it acts as a blindfold, causing a person or nation to believe they are secure in their "high habitation" while they are actually on the brink of "destruction".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H5377:</strong> Meaning to beguile, deceive, or delude.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root describing a "mental seduction".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The root <em>nāšā’</em> implies an "unnoticed" deception. It is not a sudden, violent lie but a slow "drifting" away from the "Source of Truth" until one’s "walk" is completely misaligned with reality.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Seducer's Whisper:</strong> Used to describe how Eve was "beguiled" by the serpent in the garden; it reflects a process where the "center" of a person is talked into a "malicious" or foolish decision.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The False Mirage:</strong> It carries the image of a traveler in the desert who sees "water" where there is only "chaos" and heat; the "deception" leads them to waste their strength on an illusion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a mirror that is warped; you look at yourself and see "preeminence" and "weight," but the mirror is actually hiding your "shame" and vulnerability.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>To be <strong>deceived (H5377)</strong> is the ultimate "natural pressure point" of the unregenerate heart. It reflects an "integrity gap" where the soul accepts "empty talk" as "sound doctrine". In the "house of prayer," the antidote to deception is "saving health"—the light of the Word that exposes the "insubordinate" lies we tell ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 3</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"The pride of your heart has deceived (nāšā’) you..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah highlights that Edom was not deceived by a foreign "messenger" or an external enemy, but by their own "arrogance".</p></li>
<li><p>This deception made them feel "impregnable" in their "clefts of the rock," proving that when a heart is not "temperate" and "sober," it becomes its own greatest "deceiver".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Genesis 3:13:</strong> "And the woman said, 'The serpent <strong>deceived (nāšā’)</strong> me, and I ate.'"</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Kings 18:29:</strong> "Thus says the king: 'Do not let Hezekiah <strong>deceive (nāšā’)</strong> you...'"</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jeremiah 49:16:</strong> "Your fierceness has <strong>deceived (nāšā’)</strong> you, the pride of your heart..."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>Deception is the "spiritual weight" of a lie that feels like truth. To avoid being "deceived," we must "walk" in constant "reverence" and "faithfulness" to the "Source of Truth". If our "soul prospers," it is because we have rejected the "preeminence" of our own ego and anchored our "integrity" in the "Name" of the LORD.</p>
