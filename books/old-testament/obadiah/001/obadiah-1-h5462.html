<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>DELIVERED UP — (<em>sāḡar</em>, Strong’s H5462)</strong> Refers to the act of shutting, closing, or handing over someone into the control of another.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 14</strong>, God condemns Edom because they <strong>"delivered up"</strong> the survivors of Israel who remained in the day of distress. Instead of offering a "safe voyage" or "saving health" to their kin, Edom "shut" the door on their escape and "handed them over" to the "malicious" enemy, an act of "violence" that violated the "integrity" of their brotherhood.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H5462:</strong> Meaning to shut, close, or surrender.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root describing the physical action of "closing a gate" or "locking" something away.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The word carries the "weighty" implication of removing someone's freedom. To "deliver up" is to place a person in a "tight place" where they are completely at the mercy of another.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Locked Gate:</strong> Used to describe the act of "shutting up" a city or a house to prevent "peace" or escape.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Handed-Over Prisoner:</strong> It carries the image of a person being bound and "handed over" to a "robber" or an executioner.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a trap snapping shut; <strong>delivered up (H5462)</strong> is the "natural pressure point" where all hope of "deliverance" is "cut off" by a "malicious" hand.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>delivered up (H5462)</strong> the "special people" of God is an act of "insubordinate" defiance against the "Word of the LORD". It reflects an "integrity gap" where Edom prioritized "plunder" and alliance with the "nations" over "reverence" for their brother. Because Edom "shut" the door of mercy on Israel, God would eventually "shut" them up into "complete destruction".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 14</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...Nor should you have delivered up (sāḡar) those among them who remained in the day of distress."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah highlights the "shame" of Edom’s "testimony"; they acted as "trappers" rather than family.</p></li>
<li><p>Those "who remained" were already weakened by "chaos," yet Edom "delivered" them to "slaughter" to ensure no "remnant" was left.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Joshua 6:1:</strong> "Now Jericho was securely <strong>shut up (sāḡar)</strong> because of the children of Israel..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 31:8:</strong> "And [You] have not <strong>shut (sāḡar)</strong> me up into the hand of the enemy; You have set my feet in a wide place." (The opposite of what Edom did).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Samuel 24:10:</strong> "...the LORD <strong>delivered (sāḡar)</strong> you today into my hand in the cave..."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>In our "walk," we are called to be those who "open" doors of "saving health" rather than those who "deliver up" others to "shame". To "shut" the heart against a brother in "distress" is to "despise" the "Source of Truth". True "soul prosperity" is found in "integrity"—remaining "faithful" to protect others even when "natural pressure points" tempt us to "hand them over" for our own gain.</p>
