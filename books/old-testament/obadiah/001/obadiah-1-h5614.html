<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>SEPHARAD — (<em>sĕpārāḏ</em>, Strong’s H5614)</strong> A specific "habitation" of Jewish exiles, traditionally identified by many as Sardis in Asia Minor or regions in Spain. It represents the "weighty" distance to which the "captives" were "delivered up" and "stripped" of their homeland.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 20</strong>, the "captives of Jerusalem who are in <strong>Sepharad</strong>" are promised a return to "possess" the cities of the South. This is the "divine reality" of a "safe voyage" from the farthest reaches of "chaos" back to the "integrity" of their original "inheritance".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H5614:</strong> A location of unknown certain identity, but a recognized place of exile for the "special people".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A word of uncertain origin, likely a proper name for a foreign district.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The term serves as a "testimony" of the "complete stripping" of the nation; even those "cut off" and sent to the most distant "Sepharad" are not forgotten by the "Word of the LORD".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Biblical Profile and Significance</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Far Country: A Natural Pressure Point</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Being in <strong>Sepharad</strong> meant being "exposed" to the "nations" and living in "distress" far from the "peace" of Zion.</p></li>
<li><p>It represents the "chaos" that follows an "insubordinate" walk, where one’s "habitation" is moved to a "parched place".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Promised Return: Restoration of Preeminence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah declares that the exiles in <strong>Sepharad</strong> shall "possess" the "South" (the Negeb).</p></li>
<li><p>This signifies that God is "faithful" to "search out" His people no matter how far they have been "delivered up" by "malicious" enemies.</p></li>
<li><p>It is the "divine reality" where "shame" is replaced by the "saving health" of a restored "inheritance".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Integrity of the Remnant: A Final Account</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The mention of <strong>Sepharad</strong> proves that the "Source of Truth" maintains a "faithful" record of every "remnant".</p></li>
<li><p>Their "walk" back from exile is the ultimate "testimony" that God’s "order" will prevail over the "violence" of the "house of Esau".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Insight</strong></p>
<p>The profile of <strong>Sepharad</strong> teaches us that no "natural pressure point" or distance can "cut off" the "faithful" from the "Word of the LORD". When we feel "stripped" and far from "peace," we must remain "sober" and "temperate," trusting that God is "faithful" to lead us on a "safe voyage" home. To "possess" our inheritance after a season in <strong>Sepharad</strong> is to experience the "saving health" of a God who restores our "soul prosperity" and settles the "integrity gap" of our lives.</p>
