<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>OBADIAH — (<em>‘Ōḇaḏyāh</em>, Strong’s H5662)</strong> The name means <strong>"servant of Yahweh."</strong> It is a common name in the Old Testament, borne by at least 12 different men, including King Ahab’s God-fearing steward who hid 100 prophets in caves to protect them from Jezebel (1 Kings 18:3–4).</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 1:1</strong>, Obadiah is the prophetic messenger chosen to deliver a "weighty" vision of divine justice against Edom. His life serves as a "testimony" that even a "hidden" servant can carry the full authority of the "Source of Truth" when their "walk" is aligned with God's purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H5662:</strong> Meaning "Servant of Yahweh" or "Worshiper of Yahweh".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A compound of <em>‘āḇaḏ</em> (to serve/work/worship) and <em>Yāh</em> (Yahweh).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The root <em>‘āḇaḏ</em> is unique because it blends the concepts of "labor" and "worship" into a single idea. This suggests that for Obadiah, his prophetic work was his highest act of service; there was no "integrity gap" between his daily labor and his spiritual devotion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Biblical Profile and Significance</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Man: The Hidden Prophet</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah is the most "hidden" of the minor prophets; the text provides no information regarding his lineage, hometown, or family history.</p></li>
<li><p>This deliberate anonymity serves to highlight the message over the messenger; he effectively disappears so that the "spiritual weight" of the revelation remains solely on the LORD.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Name: A Common Identity for Uncommon Service</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The name represents a "pattern of faithfulness" in Israel, marking those who were "special people" set apart to protect the truth during times of national "chaos".</p></li>
<li><p>While several men share this name, the prophet Obadiah stands out as a "fellow worker" for the truth whose "testimony" has reached every generation through his written vision.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Mission: The Voice of Divine Justice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah was called to speak during a "natural pressure point" in Israel's history—likely following the tragic sack of Jerusalem.</p></li>
<li><p>His "testimony" is the shortest book in the Old Testament, yet it carries immense "spiritual weight" as it addresses the global theme of God's sovereign judgment over "insubordinate" and "malicious" nations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Theology: The Day of the LORD</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah introduces the "Day of the LORD" not merely as a distant future event, but as a "divine reality" that is "near" for all nations.</p></li>
<li><p>He emphasizes the "unrelenting" nature of God's justice, showing that those who practice "violence" against their brethren will inevitably face the consequences of their own "evil deeds".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Insight</strong></p>
<p>Obadiah reminds us that you don't need "preeminence" or a famous pedigree to be a "faithful" witness for the truth. To be an "Obadiah" is to be a servant whose "walk" is so aligned with the Master that your own "name" is eclipsed by the "Name" of the One you serve. His life proves that "soul prosperity" is found in humble obedience rather than seeking a high reputation among men.</p>
