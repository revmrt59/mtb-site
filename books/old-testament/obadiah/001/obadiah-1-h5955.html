<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>GLEANINGS — (<em>‘ōlēlôt</em>, Strong’s H5955)</strong> Refers to the small quantity of fruit, specifically grapes or olives, left on the vine or tree after the main harvest is completed.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 5</strong>, God uses the metaphor of <strong>"gleanings"</strong> to emphasize the total and "complete destruction" of Edom. Even a typical harvester would leave some "gleanings" for the poor, but God’s judgment would be so "weighty" that not a single "hidden treasure" would be left behind.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H5955:</strong> Meaning gleanings or the "scanty harvest" left over.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>‘ālal</em> (to glean, to act severely, or to deal with thoroughly).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The root <em>‘ālal</em> carries a double meaning of "harvesting" and "dealing severely" with someone. This linguistic link suggests that a thorough "gleaning" is also a thorough "judgment" where nothing "insubordinate" or hidden is overlooked.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Compassionate Harvester:</strong> Under Mosaic Law, farmers were commanded to leave "gleanings" for the "special people" who were poor or strangers, ensuring their "saving health" and survival (Lev 19:10).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Stripped Vine:</strong> Used to describe a vine that has been so "searched out" that not even a single grape remains for the "beloved" to find.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a vacuum cleaner that removes every speck of dust; the <em>‘ōlēlôt</em> represent the "last remains" of a nation's "preeminence" being sucked away into "chaos".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>The absence of <strong>gleanings (H5955)</strong> signifies a judgment that is "complete" and without mercy. It reflects the "integrity" of a God who sees every "malicious" deed and ensures that the "evil deeds" of the "insubordinate" are fully addressed. For Edom, the lack of gleanings meant they would have no "remnant" and no "safe voyage" back to power.</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 5</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...Would they not have left some gleanings (‘ōlēlôt)?"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah poses this as a rhetorical question to show that God's "testimony" against Edom is more severe than a "natural pressure point" like a common theft.</p></li>
<li><p>While "grape-gatherers" would follow the law of "reverence" for the poor, the "Source of Truth" would "search out" Edom so thoroughly that they would be "empty" and "cut off forever".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Judges 8:2:</strong> "...Is not the <strong>gleaning (‘ōlēlôt)</strong> of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?"</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isaiah 17:6:</strong> "Yet <strong>gleaning (‘ōlēlôt)</strong> grapes will be left in it, like the shaking of an olive tree..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Micah 7:1:</strong> "Woe is me! For I am like those who gather summer fruits, like those who <strong>glean (‘ōlēlôt)</strong> vintage grapes..."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>"Gleanings" remind us that God is a God of "details." He notices the "small things" in our "walk"—both the "faithful" acts of service and the "hidden treasures" of pride. To ensure our "soul prosperity," we must "walk" with "integrity," knowing that the "Source of Truth" will one day "search out" our hearts to see if we are full of His "peace" or the "chaos" of the world.</p>
