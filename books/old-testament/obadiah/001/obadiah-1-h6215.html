<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>ESAU — (<em>‘ēśāw</em>, Strong’s H6215)</strong> The name means <strong>"hairy."</strong> He was the firstborn son of Isaac and Rebekah and the twin brother of Jacob.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 6</strong>, the prophet asks, "Oh, how <strong>Esau</strong> shall be searched out!" This uses the ancestor's name to represent the entire nation of Edom. It highlights the "divine reality" that even the most "hidden" and "hairy" defenses of the flesh cannot hide a soul from the "Source of Truth" when the time of judgment has arrived.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H6215:</strong> Meaning "Hairy" or "Rough".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Likely derived from the physical description of him at birth, being "red all over like a hairy garment" (Gen 25:25).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The name and its description are linked to the rugged, "hairy" terrain of Mount Seir. This reflects a nature that is "rough" and "natural," prioritizing the immediate "natural pressure points" of physical hunger over the "spiritual weight" of a divine inheritance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Biblical Profile and Significance</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Origin: The Profane Firstborn</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Esau is famously known for "despising" his birthright for a single meal (Gen 25:34).</p></li>
<li><p>This act created an "integrity gap" that defined his lineage; he chose the "red" of the earth over the "saving health" of God's covenant, earning him the name Edom.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Conflict: A Tale of Two Brothers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The struggle between Esau and Jacob began in the womb and continued through their descendants.</p></li>
<li><p>Esau represents the "insubordinate" and "malicious" struggle of the flesh against the "faithful" promises of God.</p></li>
<li><p>While Jacob (Israel) was the "special people" through whom the Messiah would come, Esau (Edom) became the "border of wickedness" (Mal 1:4).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Geography: The High Habitation of Seir</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Esau settled in the "high habitation" of the mountains, believing the "clefts of the rock" made his house "impregnable" (v. 3).</p></li>
<li><p>This physical "security" mirrored his "pride of heart," leading him to believe he was beyond the reach of "complete destruction".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Symbolism: The Man of the Field</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Esau was a "skillful hunter," a man of the "field" and "chaos," contrasting with Jacob who was a "mild man, dwelling in tents" (Gen 25:27).</p></li>
<li><p>In the prophetic "testimony," Esau serves as a warning to those who "walk" according to their own "arrogance" and "evil deeds" rather than "sound doctrine".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Insight</strong></p>
<p>Esau is a "divine reality" check for every "beloved" child of God: what we "despise" in the "quietness" of our hearts today will eventually be "searched out" in the light of God's justice. To be "hairy" or "rough" in the world's eyes might look like strength, but without "reverence" and "integrity," it is merely "empty talk" that leads to being "cut off forever."</p>
