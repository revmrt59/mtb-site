<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>SPOKEN — (<em>peh</em>, Strong’s H6310)</strong> While the literal Hebrew word refers to the "mouth," the <strong>NKJV</strong> translates the idiom "magnifying the mouth" as having <strong>"spoken proudly"</strong>.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 12</strong>, God rebukes Edom, saying they should not have <strong>"spoken proudly"</strong> in the day of Israel's distress. This exposes the "integrity gap" in Edom's "walk"; they used their words to pour out "malicious" boasts and "empty talk" while their brother was experiencing "chaos" and "destruction".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H6310:</strong> Meaning mouth, speech, or the opening of the face.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root describing the physical organ of speech.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The term represents the "natural pressure point" where internal "pride" becomes external "violence". To "magnify the mouth" (to have <strong>spoken</strong> proudly) is to let the "insubordinate" heart find expression.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Magnified Voice:</strong> To have "spoken proudly" carries the image of someone opening their mouth wide to "shout" over the "shame" of another.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Sword's Edge:</strong> Speech is often compared to the "edge" of a sword; Edom’s "spoken" words were sharp, cutting down the "special people" with "malicious" glee.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a fountain; what is <strong>spoken</strong> reveals whether the "soul prospers" or is full of "chaos".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>What is <strong>spoken (H6310)</strong> is the primary indicator of a person’s "reverence" for God. The "Word of the LORD" warns that we will be judged by the "testimony" of our words. For Edom, having <strong>spoken</strong> proudly was the evidence of their "pride of heart," proving they were "faithful" only to their own "arrogance".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 12</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...Nor should you have spoken (peh) proudly in the day of distress."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah notes that Edom didn't just stay silent; they actively "celebrated" the "complete stripping" of Jerusalem through what they <strong>spoken</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>This "boasting" was a "divine reality" check: those who speak proudly against the "brethren" will find that God’s judgment speaks louder.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Exodus 4:12:</strong> "Now therefore, go, and I will be with your <strong>mouth (peh)</strong> [speech] and teach you what you shall say."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 19:14:</strong> "Let the words of my <strong>mouth (peh)</strong> [what is <strong>spoken</strong>]... be acceptable in Your sight..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 18:21:</strong> "Death and life are in the power of the tongue [and what is <strong>spoken</strong>]..."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To have "soul prosperity," we must guard what is <strong>spoken</strong> with "sober" and "temperate" discipline. When we use our words for "empty talk" and "malicious" boasting, we invite "chaos" into our own "walk". Let what is <strong>spoken</strong> be a source of "saving health" and "peace," remaining "faithful" to the "Word of the LORD".</p>
