<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>MOUTH — (<em>peh</em>, Strong’s H6310)</strong> Refers to the physical organ of speech, but figuratively represents a person’s words, commands, and the "testimony" of their heart.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 12</strong>, God rebukes Edom, saying they should not have "spoken proudly"—literally, "magnified their <strong>mouth</strong>"—in the day of Israel's distress. This exposes the "integrity gap" in Edom's "walk"; they used their "mouth" to pour out "malicious" boasts and "empty talk" while their brother was experiencing "chaos" and "destruction".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H6310:</strong> Meaning mouth, opening, or speech.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root describing the "opening" of the face.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The "mouth" is the tool by which the "center" of a person is revealed; it is the "natural pressure point" where internal "pride" becomes external "violence".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Sword's Edge:</strong> The "mouth" is often compared to the "edge" of a sword (<em>pî-ḥereḇ</em>); Edom’s words were sharp and "insubordinate," cutting down the "special people" with "malicious" glee.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Magnified Voice:</strong> To "magnify the mouth" is a Hebrew idiom for "boasting" or "speaking proudly." It carries the image of someone opening their mouth wide to "shout" over the "shame" of another.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a fountain; the "mouth" is the "opening" from which either "saving health" or "poisonous" talk flows, revealing whether the "soul prospers" or is full of "chaos".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>mouth (H6310)</strong> is the primary indicator of a person’s "reverence" for God and his neighbor. The "Word of the LORD" warns that we will be judged by the "testimony" of our words. For Edom, their "mouth" was the evidence of their "pride of heart," proving that they were "faithful" only to their own "arrogance" rather than to the covenant bond of "Jacob".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 12</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...Nor should you have spoken proudly (magnified your mouth—peh) in the day of distress."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah notes that Edom didn't just stay silent; they used their "mouth" to actively "celebrate" the "complete stripping" of Jerusalem.</p></li>
<li><p>This "boasting" was a "divine reality" check: those who "magnify" their mouth against the "brethren" will find that God "magnifies" His judgment against them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Exodus 4:12:</strong> "Now therefore, go, and I will be with your <strong>mouth (peh)</strong> and teach you what you shall say."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 19:14:</strong> "Let the words of my <strong>mouth (peh)</strong> and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in Your sight..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 18:21:</strong> "Death and life are in the power of the tongue [and the <strong>mouth</strong>]..."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To have "soul prosperity," we must guard our "mouth" with "sober" and "temperate" discipline. When we use our "opening" for "empty talk" and "malicious" boasting, we invite "chaos" into our own "walk". Let our "mouth" be a source of "saving health" and "peace," speaking only what is "sound" and "faithful" to the "Word of the LORD".</p>
