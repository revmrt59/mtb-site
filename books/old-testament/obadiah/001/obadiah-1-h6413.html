<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>DELIVERANCE — (<em>pĕlêṭâ</em>, Strong’s H6413)</strong> Refers to an escape, a remnant, or the act of being rescued from a great "destruction".</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 17</strong>, God promises that "on Mount Zion there shall be <strong>deliverance</strong>". This is the "divine reality" for the "special people" of God: though they faced "chaos" and a "natural pressure point" of judgment, a "faithful" remnant would be "delivered" to find "saving health" and restoration.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H6413:</strong> Meaning escape, deliverance, or a remnant that has escaped.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>pālaṭ</em> (H6403), meaning to cause to escape, to carry away to safety, or to deliver.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The word carries the "weighty" sense of surviving a "complete stripping" or a "calamity" that has consumed others. It is the "safe voyage" provided by God out of the midst of "chaos".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Survivor of the Sword:</strong> Used to describe those who remain after a "malicious" invasion; they are the "integrity" of the nation that survives to carry on the "testimony".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Seed in the Field:</strong> It carries the image of a "remnant" of seed that escapes a drought to bring new life—a symbol of "soul prosperity" after a season of "distress".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a person pulling a small "remnant" of cloth from a fire; <strong>deliverance (H6413)</strong> is the "saving health" of what is pulled out before the "destruction" is absolute.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deliverance (H6413)</strong> is the ultimate act of God’s "sovereignty". It reflects the "divine reality" that even when the "nations" seek to "cut off" His people, God preserves a "faithful" group to inherit His "peace". For Edom, there would be "no survivor" (v. 18), but for Jacob, there would be <strong>deliverance</strong> on Mount Zion—proving that God’s "order" will always protect His "sanctity".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 17</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"But on Mount Zion there shall be deliverance (pĕlêṭâ), and there shall be holiness..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah highlights that this "deliverance" is linked to "holiness"; it is not just physical escape, but a return to "reverence" and "sound" worship.</p></li>
<li><p>While Edom "gazed" on Israel's "chaos," the "Word of the LORD" declares a "safe voyage" for the very ones Edom tried to "deliver up" to the enemy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Genesis 45:7:</strong> "And God sent me before you to preserve a posterity... and to save your lives by a great <strong>deliverance (pĕlêṭâ)</strong>."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ezra 9:8:</strong> "...to leave us a <strong>remnant to escape (pĕlêṭâ)</strong>, and to give us a peg in His holy place..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Joel 2:32:</strong> "...For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be <strong>deliverance (pĕlêṭâ)</strong>, as the LORD has said..."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To find true <strong>deliverance</strong>, we must "walk" in "integrity" and "reverence" for the LORD. While the world relies on "mighty men" and "high habitations" for safety, these are "empty talk" in the day of "distress". Our "saving health" is found only on "Mount Zion," where the "Source of Truth" promises a "safe voyage" for those who are "faithful" to Him.</p>
