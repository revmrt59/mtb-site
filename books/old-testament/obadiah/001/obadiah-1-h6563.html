<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>CROSSROADS — (<em>pereq</em>, Strong’s H6563)</strong> Refers to a fork in the road, a breach, or a place of "parting ways"; it describes the specific point where paths divide.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 14</strong>, God rebukes Edom for standing at the <strong>"crossroads"</strong> to intercept and "cut off" those who were fleeing the "destruction" of Jerusalem. This reveals the "malicious" and "premeditated" nature of their "violence"; they didn't just watch the "chaos" from afar, they strategically positioned themselves to ensure their brother had no "safe voyage" or "saving health".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H6563:</strong> Meaning a crossway, a parting of the way, or a breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>pāraq</em> (H6561), meaning to "break off," "tear away," or "deliver".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The root carries the idea of "tearing" or "breaking apart". While the root can mean "deliverance," Edom used the <strong>crossroads</strong> as a place of "shame" and "slaughter," turning a potential place of escape into a "natural pressure point" of death.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Predator at the Pass:</strong> Used to describe a place where a "robber" or predator waits for prey to arrive at a point of indecision; it reflects the "insubordinate" and "malicious" heart of Edom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Broken Wall:</strong> It carries the image of a "breach" where the "integrity" of a defense has failed, leaving the "special people" exposed to "violence".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a hunter blocking the only exit from a "high habitation"; the <strong>crossroads (H6563)</strong> represents the final opportunity for "peace" that Edom "stripped" away from Israel.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>crossroads (H6563)</strong> is a "testimony" of choice. While God was "searching out" Israel through judgment, Edom’s presence at the crossroads proved they "despised" their "brother". Their "walk" at the fork in the road was one of "wickedness" rather than "reverence," resulting in a "divine reality" where they would eventually be "cut off" themselves.</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 14</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"You should not have stood at the crossroads (pereq) to cut off those among them who escaped..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah highlights the "cruelty" of Edom’s geography; they used their knowledge of the local "parting ways" to block any "saving health" for the refugees.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of offering "hospitality" at the "crossroads," they acted with "violence," turning the "peace" of the mountain into a "slaughter".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Nahum 3:1:</strong> "Woe to the bloody city! It is all full of lies and <strong>robbery (pereq)</strong>..." (The word here refers to the "plunder" taken at the breach).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 7:2:</strong> "...Lest they tear me like a lion, <strong>rending (pāraq)</strong> me in pieces..." (The root action of what happens at the <strong>crossroads</strong>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>In our "walk," we often come to <strong>crossroads</strong> where we must choose between "malicious" self-interest and "faithful" love for our "brethren". To find "soul prosperity," we must not "stand" at the breach to exploit others' "chaos," but rather offer a "safe voyage" and "saving health". True "integrity" is revealed in how we treat those who are "escaping" their own "natural pressure points".</p>
