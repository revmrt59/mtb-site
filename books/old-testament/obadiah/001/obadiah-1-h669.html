<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>EPHRAIM — (<em>’ep̄rayim</em>, Strong’s H669)</strong> The name of Joseph’s second son, meaning "double fruitfulness". As a tribe, it often represents the "preeminence" of the northern kingdom of Israel.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 19</strong>, the restoration of the "fields of <strong>Ephraim</strong>" signifies a "weighty" return to the "integrity" of the original "inheritance". While the "chaos" of the "nations" had "stripped" these lands and led to "destruction," the "divine reality" of the "Day of the LORD" ensures that the "faithful" remnant will once again "possess" this "special" territory as a "saving health".</p>

<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H669:</strong> Meaning "double fruit" or "doubly fruitful".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>pārâ</em> (H6509), meaning to bear fruit or be fruitful.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The name reflects the "Source of Truth" in Joseph's life: that God made him "fruitful" in the land of his "distress". It is the "testimony" of "soul prosperity" emerging from a "natural pressure point".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Biblical Profile and Significance</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Leading Tribe: Power and Responsibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ephraim</strong> was the "preeminent" tribe of the north, but often struggled with "pride" and "insubordinate" walks.</p></li>
<li><p>Their "empty talk" and "rebellion" against the "house of Jacob" (Judah) led to a "complete stripping" and exile by the "nations".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Reclaimed Fields: Restoration of Order</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah 19 places the "fields of <strong>Ephraim</strong>" back into the hands of the "house of Jacob".</p></li>
<li><p>This represents a "divine reality" where the "chaos" of divided kingdoms is replaced by the "peace" of a unified people "possessing" their "possessions".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Sign of Fruitfulness: Saving Health</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The restoration of <strong>Ephraim</strong> is a "testimony" that God is "faithful" to His "Word" even when His people have been "maliciously" treated by their enemies.</p></li>
<li><p>It signifies a return to "sanctity" and "reverence," where the land once lost to "violence" becomes a place of "saving health".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Insight</strong></p>
<p>The profile of <strong>Ephraim</strong> reminds us that true "fruitfulness" is found only through "integrity" and "reverence" for the LORD. When we "walk" in "pride," we invite "chaos" and the loss of our "habitation". However, the "Source of Truth" promises a "safe voyage" back to our "inheritance" if we remain "sober" and "faithful" to His "order". We must trust that God will "add" to our lives and restore the "fields" of our "soul prosperity".</p>
