<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>ZAREPHATH — (<em>ṣārĕp̄aṯ</em>, Strong’s H6886)</strong> A Phoenician town located between Tyre and Sidon; the name means "refining-place" or "smelting". It represents a "weighty" location of testing and "divine reality" where God provides "saving health" in the midst of "chaos".</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 20</strong>, <strong>Zarephath</strong> serves as the northern boundary of the restored "inheritance". God declares that the "captives" of Israel shall possess the land "as far as <strong>Zarephath</strong>," signifying a "complete stripping" of the enemy’s control and a return to the full "preeminence" of the land promised to the "house of Jacob".</p>

<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The word carries the "natural pressure point" of the furnace; it is where the "integrity" of a person or metal is "searched out" and purified.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Biblical Profile and Significance</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Place of Refining: The Widow’s Provision</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Zarephath</strong> is most famous as the place where Elijah was sent during a "calamity" of famine.</p></li>
<li><p>It was a "refining-place" for both the prophet and the widow, proving that "reverence" for the "Word of the LORD" brings "peace" and "soul prosperity" even in a "parched place".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Boundary of Restoration: Possessing the North</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In Obadiah's "testimony," the possession of <strong>Zarephath</strong> indicates that the "special people" will no longer be "cut off" from their northern territories.</p></li>
<li><p>Reaching "as far as <strong>Zarephath</strong>" shows the "faithfulness" of God to restore the "remnant" to a "habitation" that extends beyond their previous "shame".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Smelting Furnace: From Chaos to Sanctity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>As a place of "refining," <strong>Zarephath</strong> represents the "divine reality" that the "distress" of the "captives" was not for "destruction," but for "purification".</p></li>
<li><p>The "insubordinate" elements of the "nations" are "stripped" away, leaving a "holy" land for a "faithful" people.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Insight</strong></p>
<p>The profile of <strong>Zarephath</strong> teaches us that our "natural pressure points" are often the very "refining-places" God uses to prepare us for our "inheritance". When we "walk" through the "fire" of "calamity," we must remain "sober" and "faithful," trusting that the LORD is "searching out" our "integrity" to bring us into "saving health". To "possess" <strong>Zarephath</strong> is to recognize that even our places of "testing" will eventually become part of our "peace" and "soul prosperity".</p>
