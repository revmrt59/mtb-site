<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>GAZED — (<em>rā’â</em>, Strong’s H7200)</strong> Refers to the act of seeing, looking, or beholding; in this context, it implies looking with a "malicious" satisfaction or gloating over someone’s misfortune.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 12</strong>, God rebukes Edom, saying, "But you should not have <strong>gazed</strong> on the day of your brother." This was more than a casual observation; it was a "weighty" sin of the heart where Edom found a "rejoicing" in the "chaos" and "destruction" of Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H7200:</strong> Meaning to see, look at, or inspect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root describing the physical act of sight.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> While the word often refers to physical sight, it frequently carries a "mental" or "spiritual" dimension—to "see" with understanding or to "behold" with a specific intent. In Obadiah, it describes a "walk" of the eyes that is completely devoid of "reverence" for the "brethren".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Watchman:</strong> Used to describe someone standing on a wall to "see" approaching danger; Edom, however, watched from their "high habitation" with "insubordinate" pleasure rather than warning their brother.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Feast for the Eyes:</strong> It carries the image of "feeding" the soul on the suffering of others—a "malicious" use of sight that turns "saving health" into a "stumbling block".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of someone standing on the "other side" of a canyon, safely watching a "safe voyage" turn into a shipwreck and "cheering" as the vessel goes down.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>gaze (H7200)</strong> at the suffering of God's "special people" is a "divine reality" that God takes personally. It reflects an "integrity gap" where the observer "despises" the covenant bond and rejoices in "iniquity". For Edom, their "gaze" was the "testimony" that led to their own "shame," proving that God sees not just what we do, but how we "look" at the trials of others.</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 12</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"But you should not have gazed (rā’â) on the day of your brother in the day of his captivity..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah uses this to expose Edom's "passive violence"; they didn't just strike Israel, they "feasted" their eyes on Israel's "chaos".</p></li>
<li><p>This "gazing" was a "natural pressure point" that revealed their true "insubordinate" nature, leading to the "Word of the LORD" pronouncing their own "complete stripping".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Genesis 1:4:</strong> "And God <strong>saw (rā’â)</strong> the light, that it was good..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 22:17:</strong> "...They look and <strong>stare (rā’â)</strong> at Me." (The same "malicious" gaze directed at the Messiah).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 35:21:</strong> "...They said, 'Aha, aha! Our eyes have <strong>seen (rā’â)</strong> it.'"</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>What we choose to "gaze" upon determines the "peace" of our "soul". To "gaze" with "malicious" joy at another's "natural pressure point" is a "walk" toward "destruction". We must be "sober" and "temperate," training our eyes to see others with the "saving health" of compassion, ensuring our "integrity" is found in "reverence" rather than "empty talk" and "pride".</p>
