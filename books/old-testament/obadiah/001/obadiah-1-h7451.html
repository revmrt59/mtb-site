<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>AFFLICTION — (<em>rā‘â</em>, Strong’s H7451)</strong> Refers to evil, misery, or distress; it describes a state of "chaos" and suffering that is "weighty" and difficult to bear.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 13</strong>, God rebukes Edom, saying, "Indeed, you should not have gazed on their <strong>affliction</strong> in the day of their calamity." While Israel was enduring the "natural pressure point" of divine discipline, Edom watched with "malicious" satisfaction, treating their brother's "misery" as a source of "rejoicing."</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H7451:</strong> Meaning bad, evil, or affliction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>rā‘a‘</em> (H7489), meaning to be evil, bad, or to "shatter".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The term carries a moral and physical "weight," often describing the "destruction" that follows an "insubordinate" walk. In this context, it is the "suffering" that results from a national "chaos."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Shattered Vessel:</strong> Used to describe an object that has been "broken" and rendered "empty"; it reflects a person or nation whose "integrity" has been compromised by "evil" circumstances.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Bitter Fruit:</strong> It carries the image of something "unpleasant" to the taste—the "natural" consequence of a "walk" that has "turned aside" from "saving health."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a storm that "strips" a garden of its "preeminence"; <strong>affliction (H7451)</strong> is the "chaos" left in its wake.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p><strong>Affliction (H7451)</strong> is a "divine reality" used by God to "search out" the heart. For Israel, it was a "weighty" correction; for Edom, their reaction to that affliction revealed an "integrity gap" that led to their own "complete stripping." God warns that to "gaze" at a brother's affliction with "malicious" intent is to invite "shame" and "destruction" upon one's own house.</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 13</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...Indeed, you should not have gazed on their affliction (rā‘â) in the day of their calamity..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah highlights that Edom was "faithful" only to their own "pride"; they "despised" the bond of "Jacob" and feasted their eyes on the "destruction" of Jerusalem.</p></li>
<li><p>This "gazing" was an "insubordinate" act that turned "saving health" into "violence" and "shame."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Genesis 48:16:</strong> "The Angel who has redeemed me from all <strong>evil (rā‘â)</strong>..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 23:4:</strong> "...I will fear no <strong>evil (rā‘â)</strong>; for You are with me..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 34:19:</strong> "Many are the <strong>afflictions (rā‘â)</strong> of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him out of them all."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To find "soul prosperity," we must not "walk" in the path of "malicious" joy over another's <strong>affliction</strong>. When we see a brother in "chaos," our "testimony" should be one of "saving health" and "peace," rather than "empty talk" or "pride." True "integrity" is found in "reverence" for the "Word of the LORD," knowing that He is the "Source of Truth" who delivers us from all "destruction."</p>
