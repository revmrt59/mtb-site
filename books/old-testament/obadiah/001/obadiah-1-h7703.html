<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>ROBBERS — (<em>šōḏēḏîm</em>, Strong’s H7703)</strong> Refers to those who plunder, spoil, or lay waste to others, often with violence or suddenness.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 5</strong>, God uses the metaphor of <strong>"robbers"</strong> to highlight the "complete destruction" awaiting Edom. While ordinary "robbers" by night might only take "till they had enough," God's judgment would be so "weighty" and thorough that Edom would be left with "nothing".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H7703:</strong> Meaning to deal violently with, despoil, or devastate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root describing the act of "shattering" or "laying waste".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The root <em>šāḏaḏ</em> is etymologically related to <em>šēḏ</em> (demon/destroyer), emphasizing a "malicious" and "ruthless" level of destruction. It is the "natural pressure point" of a total loss where the "integrity" of a home or nation is violently breached.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Night Intruder:</strong> Used to describe the "chaos" of a midnight raid where the "peace" of the household is shattered by an "insubordinate" enemy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Devastated Field:</strong> It carries the image of a field that has been "searched out" and stripped of all its "testimony" and life.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a vase being smashed into "empty" pieces; a <em>šōḏēḏ</em> does not just steal; they "destroy" the functional "order" of whatever they touch.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>The arrival of <strong>robbers (H7703)</strong> in prophecy often signifies the "divine reality" that God has removed His protection. It reflects the "shame" that follows "preeminence" when a nation chooses to "walk" in "pride" rather than "reverence". For Edom, who once acted as "robbers" toward Israel’s "chaos," they would now experience a "saving health" in reverse—a "complete stripping" of their own "high habitation".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 5</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"If thieves had come to you, if robbers (šōḏēḏîm) by night..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah contrasts human "robbers," who have a "limit" to their greed, with the "weighty" judgment of God, which has no such limit until justice is satisfied.</p></li>
<li><p>This underscores the "destruction" of Edom’s "security"; their "clefts of the rock" would offer no barrier to the "Source of Truth" when He comes to "search out" their hidden treasures.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Judges 2:14:</strong> "...and He delivered them into the hands of <strong>plunderers (šāsa/šāḏaḏ)</strong> who despoiled them..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 137:8:</strong> "O daughter of Babylon, who are to be <strong>destroyed (šāḏaḏ)</strong>..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jeremiah 48:18:</strong> "...for the <strong>plunderer (šōḏēḏ)</strong> of Moab has come against you..."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To avoid the "robber" of our "soul prosperity," we must "walk" in a way that is "faithful" to God's "sound doctrine". When we build our lives on the "pride" of our own "high habitation," we invite the "chaos" that leads to being "cut off". True "peace" is found in letting the "Source of Truth" be our "fortress," so that we are never "searched out" and found "empty".</p>
