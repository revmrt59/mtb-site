<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>REPORT — (<em>šĕmû‘â</em>, Strong’s H8052)</strong> Refers to tidings, news, or a message that is heard.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 1:1</strong>, the prophet declares, "We have heard a <strong>report</strong> from the LORD." This indicates that the prophecy is not a rumor or human speculation, but an official announcement from the heavenly court. It is the "Source of Truth" breaking into the "chaos" of human history to announce a "divine reality".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H8052:</strong> Meaning "something heard," "rumor," or "fame".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>šāma‘</em> (to hear, listen, or obey).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The root emphasizes more than just the physical act of hearing; it implies a "hearing with interest" or an "obedient listening". A <em>šĕmû‘â</em> is a message so "weighty" that it demands a response from the listener.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Royal Herald:</strong> Used to describe the news brought by a messenger from a distant battlefield or a king’s decree.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Sounding Alarm:</strong> It carries the image of a report that spreads quickly through a city, shifting the atmosphere from "peace" to urgency as the "natural pressure points" of life are addressed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a stone dropped into a still pond; the <em>šĕmû‘â</em> is the ripple effect of God’s voice moving through the nations, exposing "insubordinate" hearts and comforting the "beloved".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>report (H8052)</strong> from the LORD is the foundation of "sound doctrine". It reflects the "integrity" of God’s Word, which remains "faithful" even when human reports are "malicious" or "empty talk". In Obadiah, this report is the "testimony" that God’s "saving health" and justice are about to be revealed.</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 1:1</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...We have heard a report (šĕmû‘â) from the LORD..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>By using the plural "we," Obadiah aligns himself with the other "faithful" prophets who have received the same "spiritual weight" of revelation.</p></li>
<li><p>The "report" serves as a "divine reality" check: while Edom hears reports of their own "preeminence," God’s report announces their "destruction".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Isaiah 53:1:</strong> "Who has believed our <strong>report (šĕmû‘â)</strong>? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?"</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jeremiah 49:14:</strong> "I have heard a <strong>report (šĕmû‘â)</strong> from the LORD, and a messenger has been sent to the nations..." (A parallel to Obadiah’s message).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 25:25:</strong> "As cold water to a weary soul, so is good <strong>news (šĕmû‘â)</strong> from a far country."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>A "report" from God is never just information; it is an invitation to "walk" in the truth. When we hear what God says about our "natural pressure points," we must choose whether to listen with "reverence" or to remain "insubordinate." To believe the "report" is to find "peace" and "soul prosperity" in the midst of a world filled with "chaos."</p>
