<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>SAMARIA — (<em>šōmĕrôn</em>, Strong’s H8111)</strong> Meaning "Watch-mountain" or "Watch-tower."</p>
<p>Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, established by King Omri. After the Assyrian captivity, it became a region of syncretistic worship and ethnic tension, eventually serving as the primary cultural bridge for the Gospel’s expansion from the Jews to the Gentiles in the New Testament.</p>

<p><strong>I. The Royal Foundation: The Hill of Shemer</strong></p>
<p>The city was not an ancient tribal allotment but a strategic political purchase. In <strong>1 Kings 16:24</strong>, King Omri bought the hill from Shemer for two talents of silver. Its name, <em>šōmĕrôn</em>, aptly describes its geography—a fortified hill with a commanding view of the surrounding valleys. Under the Omride dynasty (specifically Ahab), it became a center of opulence, famous for its "ivory house" (1 Kings 22:39; Amos 3:15), but also the epicenter of Canaanite Baal worship.</p>
<p><strong>II. The Assyrian Crisis and the "Mixed" Heritage</strong></p>
<p>The definitive turning point for Samaria occurred in <strong>722 BC</strong>. After a three-year siege, the Assyrians captured the city (2 Kings 17).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Deportation:</strong> The "ten lost tribes" were carried away.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Importation:</strong> The King of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Ava, Hamath, and Sepharvaim to settle in the cities of Samaria.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Religious Synthesis:</strong> These settlers feared the Lord but also served their own gods (2 Kings 17:33). This "half-and-half" spirituality created the deep-seated Jewish prejudice that Samaritans were not "true" Israelites, but rather <em>Kuthim</em> (men from Cuthah).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. The Post-Exilic Breach</strong></p>
<p>When the Jews returned from Babylonian exile to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem, the Samaritans offered to help. Zerubbabel and the Jewish leaders refused (<strong>Ezra 4:1-3</strong>), asserting that the Samaritans had no portion in Israel. This rejection led to centuries of hostility, including the construction of the rival Samaritan temple on <strong>Mount Gerizim</strong> (approx. 400 BC), which the Hasmonean king John Hyrcanus eventually destroyed in 128 BC, further embittering the two groups.</p>
<p><strong>IV. The Christological Reclamation: John 4</strong></p>
<p>By the time of Jesus, the animosity was so high that many Jews traveled extra miles to avoid Samaria. Jesus’ encounter at Jacob’s Well breaks three major barriers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>The Ethnic Barrier:</strong> He engages a "half-breed" Samaritan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Gender Barrier:</strong> He speaks publicly with a woman.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Liturgical Barrier:</strong> When she asks about the "place" of worship (Gerizim vs. Jerusalem), Jesus declares that the <em>place</em> is irrelevant. God is seeking those who worship in <strong>Spirit and Truth</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>V. The Missional Pivot: Acts 1 and 8</strong></p>
<p>Samaria is the vital link in the Great Commission. In <strong>Acts 1:8</strong>, Jesus specifically names Samaria as the second stage of expansion.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Outpouring:</strong> In <strong>Acts 8</strong>, Philip the Evangelist goes to the city of Samaria. The response is overwhelming.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Integration:</strong> When Peter and John (the "Sons of Thunder" who once wanted to incinerate a Samaritan village in Luke 9:54) arrive to pray for them, the gift of the Holy Spirit proves that the "outsiders" are now full citizens of the Kingdom.</p></li>
</ul>
