<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>JUDGE — (<em>šāp̄aṭ</em>, Strong’s H8199)</strong> Refers to the act of governing, deciding a cause, or executing a sentence; it describes a "weighty" restoration of "order" and "integrity".</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 21</strong>, the prophecy reaches its climax as saviors ascend Mount Zion to <strong>"judge"</strong> the mountains of Esau. This is the final "testimony" of the book: the "malicious" pride and "violence" of Edom are finally answered by a "divine reality" of justice, where the "Source of Truth" settles the "integrity gap" and establishes His "preeminence" over all the nations.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H8199:</strong> Meaning to judge, govern, vindicate, or punish.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root meaning to exercise the process of government.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The word carries the sense of "setting things right"; it is the "natural pressure point" where "chaos" is subdued by "sound" law and "reverence" for the LORD.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Seat of Authority:</strong> Used to describe a king or leader who "searches out" the truth to protect the "special people" and "strip" the wicked of their power.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Scaled Balance:</strong> It carries the image of weighing a "walk" against the "Word of the LORD"; it is the ultimate "integrity" check for a nation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a gardener "cutting off" dead branches so the rest of the vine can have "soul prosperity"; to <strong>judge (H8199)</strong> is to remove "wickedness" to allow "peace" to flourish.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>judge (H8199)</strong> is the "divine reality" that ends the "empty talk" of the world. While Edom "gazed" on Israel's "calamity" with "insubordinate" joy, the "Day of the LORD" brings a "weighty" reversal where the victims become the "saviors" who execute God's "order". This ensures that "holiness" is restored to the "holy mountain" and "shame" is returned to the "house of Esau".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 21</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...to judge (šāp̄aṭ) the mountains of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD’S."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah uses this word to transition from "destruction" to "governance".</p></li>
<li><p>The "judgment" is not just a "complete stripping" of Edom, but the establishment of a "safe habitation" under the "saving health" of the LORD’S reign.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Genesis 18:25:</strong> "Shall not the <strong>Judge (šāp̄aṭ)</strong> of all the earth do right?"</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 96:13:</strong> "...For He is coming to <strong>judge (šāp̄aṭ)</strong> the earth. He shall judge the world with righteousness..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isaiah 2:4:</strong> "He shall <strong>judge (šāp̄aṭ)</strong> between the nations, and rebuke many people...".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To find "soul prosperity," we must welcome the <strong>judgment</strong> of the LORD in our own lives now. When we allow Him to "search out" our hearts and "strip" away "malicious" pride or "empty talk," we are prepared for His "peace". True "integrity" is found in "walking" according to His "order," knowing that while the "Day of the LORD" brings "chaos" to the "insubordinate," it brings "saving health" and a "safe voyage" into the "kingdom" for the "faithful".</p>
