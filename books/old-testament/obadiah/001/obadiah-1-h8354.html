<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>DRINK — (<em>šāṯâ</em>, Strong’s H8354)</strong> Refers to the act of imbibing liquid, but figuratively describes the full "participation" in an experience, whether it be a celebratory feast or the cup of divine "judgment".</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 16</strong>, the word is used to contrast two types of drinking. While Edom "drank" on God's holy mountain in a "malicious" celebration of Israel’s "chaos," God declares that the nations shall "drink" the "weighty" consequences of their "insubordinate" actions.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H8354:</strong> Meaning to drink, imbibe, or feast.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root describing the consumption of liquids.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The term carries a "mental" and "spiritual" dimension; to "drink" is to internalize and fully "experience" a condition. In the "Word of the LORD," it often represents the "natural pressure point" of receiving the "testimony" of one's own "walk".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Banqueting House:</strong> Used to describe "rejoicing" and "peace" during a festival. Edom turned the "house of prayer" into a place of "malicious" feasting over their brother's "destruction".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Cup of Wrath:</strong> It carries the image of a "weighty" cup filled with "chaos" that must be drained to the dregs. To <strong>drink (H8354)</strong> this cup is to face the "complete stripping" of one's "pride".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a man drinking water that has been poisoned; he "participates" in the very thing that brings his "destruction".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>The act of <strong>drinking (H8354)</strong> reflects the "integrity" of God’s justice: what a nation "pours out" in "violence," they must eventually "swallow" as "judgment". For Edom, their "insubordinate" drinking on the "holy mountain" was a "despising" of God’s "sanctity," requiring a "divine reality" where they would "drink and swallow" until they were "cut off" forever.</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 16</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"For as you drank (šāṯâ) on My holy mountain, so shall all the nations drink (šāṯâ) continually..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah uses the word to show the "reprisal" for Edom’s "malicious" joy; their "celebration" becomes the "Source of Truth" for their own "shame".</p></li>
<li><p>While Edom "drank" in a "moment" of "chaos," the nations would "drink" a "continual" cup of "destruction".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Genesis 9:21:</strong> "Then he <strong>drank (šāṯâ)</strong> of the wine and was drunk, and became uncovered..." (A loss of "sober" discipline).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 36:8:</strong> "They are abundantly satisfied... and You give them <strong>drink (šāṯâ)</strong> from the river of Your pleasures." (A drink of "saving health" and "peace").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jeremiah 25:15:</strong> "...Take this wine cup of fury from My hand, and cause all the nations... to <strong>drink (šāṯâ)</strong> it.".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>To find "soul prosperity," we must be "temperate" and "sober," being careful what we choose to <strong>drink</strong> into our spirits. If we "drink" in "malicious" pride or "empty talk," we will eventually "drink" the "chaos" of judgment. Let us "walk" in "reverence," drinking only from the "saving health" of the "Word of the LORD," so that our "testimony" is one of "peace" rather than "destruction".</p>
