<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>TEMAN — (<em>tēmān</em>, Strong’s H8487)</strong> The name means <strong>"south"</strong> or <strong>"southward."</strong> It was a principal city and district in <strong>Edom</strong>, named after the grandson of Esau.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 9</strong>, the prophet addresses the city directly: "Then your mighty men, O <strong>Teman</strong>, shall be dismayed." This signifies that the very "heart" of Edom’s military and intellectual strength would crumble under the "weight" of divine judgment, proving that no "high habitation" or "wise reputation" can withstand the "Source of Truth."</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H8487:</strong> Meaning "south" or "the southern quarter."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>yāmîn</em> (the right hand), because when one faces east, the south is to the right.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The "right hand" is often associated with "strength" and "skill." Teman represented the "right hand" of Edom—their best and most "faithful" defense—yet even this "mighty" strength would fail.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Biblical Profile and Significance</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Origin: The Lineage of Esau</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Teman was the son of Eliphaz and the grandson of Esau (Gen 36:11, 15).</p></li>
<li><p>As a "duke" or chief of Edom, he established a "testimony" of leadership that became synonymous with the region's power and "preeminence."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Reputation: The Home of Wise Men</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Teman was renowned throughout the ancient world for its wisdom and "understanding."</p></li>
<li><p>This is why <strong>Eliphaz the Temanite</strong>, one of Job’s friends, is presented as a "wise man" who speaks with "weighty" authority (Job 2:11).</p></li>
<li><p>However, Obadiah warns that even the most "sound" human wisdom becomes "empty talk" when it is "insubordinate" to God (v. 8).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Geography: The Southern Stronghold</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Located in the northern part of the Edomite territory, Teman served as a critical "border" and military hub.</p></li>
<li><p>Its "might" was legendary, yet the prophet declares its "mighty men" will be "dismayed," turning their "peace" into "chaos" and total "destruction."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Judgment: Cut Off by Slaughter</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The prophet Ezekiel also targets Teman, declaring that God would stretch out His hand and "make it desolate" (Ezek 25:13).</p></li>
<li><p>Teman’s fall serves as a "divine reality" check: human "integrity" and "wisdom" cannot save a nation that has participated in "violence" against the brethren.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Insight</strong></p>
<p>Teman reminds us that we cannot rely on our own "right hand" for security. Whether it is our "intelligence," our "reputation," or our "mighty" resources, these are only "safe" when they are anchored in "reverence" for the LORD. To find "soul prosperity" and "saving health," we must look past our own "wisdom" and "walk" in the light of the "Source of Truth."</p>
