<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>ENTERED — (<em>bô’</em>, Strong’s H935)</strong> Refers to the act of coming in, entering, or arriving at a specific destination.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 13</strong>, God declares that Edom should not have <strong>"entered"</strong> the gate of His people. This was more than a simple arrival; it was an unauthorized and "malicious" intrusion into the "sanctity" of Jerusalem during its "chaos". While the "foreigners" broke the gates, Edom's "entered" walk was a betrayal of their "brother," turning their "preeminence" into a "testimony" of "shame".</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H935:</strong> Meaning to go in, enter, or come.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root describing the movement from one space into another.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The word carries the "weight" of intent; to "enter" is to participate in the "reality" of a space. In this context, it describes an "insubordinate" step into a place where they did not belong, violating the "integrity" of their brother’s home.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Threshold:</strong> To "enter" a gate was to be "hospitalized" or to become an "invader". Edom chose the path of "violence" rather than "peace".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Setting Sun:</strong> The word is often used for the sun "going down" (entering the horizon); it reflects a "natural pressure point" where one phase ends and another begins.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a thief "entering" a house of mourning to steal; it is a "malicious" act that disregards the "saving health" of the suffering.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>entered (H935)</strong> into the suffering of others with the intent to plunder is a "divine reality" that God judges severely. It reflects an "integrity gap" where a person "despises" the boundaries set by God. For Edom, their "entered" status in Jerusalem was the evidence of their "pride," leading to their "complete stripping" and being "cut off".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 13</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"You should not have entered (bô’) the gate of My people..."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah highlights that Edom was not "faithful" to the familial bond; they "entered" as "strangers" and "foreigners" rather than as kin.</p></li>
<li><p>This "entered" action was a "natural pressure point" for Israel, but it became a "weighty" decree of "destruction" for Edom.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Genesis 7:13:</strong> "On that very same day Noah... <strong>entered (bô’)</strong> the ark..." (A "safe voyage" entrance).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exodus 15:19:</strong> "...and the LORD brought back the waters of the sea upon them. But the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea." (An entrance into "saving health").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 100:4:</strong> "<strong>Enter (bô’)</strong> into His gates with thanksgiving...".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>Our "walk" is defined by which gates we choose to <strong>enter</strong>. To "enter" into "chaos" and "malicious" behavior is to "despise" the "Word of the LORD". We must remain "sober" and "temperate," ensuring we only "enter" where we are "called" to bring "peace" and "saving health," maintaining our "integrity" in the "Source of Truth".</p>
