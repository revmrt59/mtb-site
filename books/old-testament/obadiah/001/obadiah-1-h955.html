<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>SHAME — (<em>bušâ</em>, Strong’s H955)</strong> Refers to a state of public disgrace, humiliation, or the feeling of being "confounded" and "put to shame".</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 10</strong>, God declares that because of their violence, <strong>"shame"</strong> shall cover Edom. This is the "divine reality" of their reversal: the nation that once stood in the "preeminence" of their "high habitation" would now be "clothed" in the visible "testimony" of their own "malicious" failure.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H955:</strong> Meaning shame, humiliation, or disgrace.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> Derived from <em>bôš</em> (to be ashamed, to be disappointed, or to be delayed).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The root implies more than just a private emotion; it describes the "shame" of a failed "integrity" or a plan that has come to "chaos". It is the "weighty" disappointment that occurs when what a person trusted in (like Edom’s fortresses) fails to protect them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Disappointed Hope:</strong> Used to describe a traveler who arrives at a "dried-up well"; the "shame" is the realization that their source of "peace" was a "deception".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Exposed Face:</strong> It carries the image of someone being "stripped" of their outer garments (their reputation) and forced to stand "empty" before their "nations".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a white garment being stained with "red" dye; the "shame" becomes a "weight" that "covers" the entire person, making their "insubordinate" nature visible to all.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p><strong>Shame (H955)</strong> is the ultimate "natural pressure point" for those who "walk" in "pride". It reflects the "integrity" of God’s justice: those who "despise" the "brethren" will eventually be "clothed" in the very "shame" they tried to inflict on others. For the "faithful," God promises that they "shall not be ashamed," but for the "malicious," shame is the "testimony" of their "complete destruction".</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 10</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...Shame (bušâ) shall cover you, and you shall be cut off forever."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obadiah uses the word "cover" to show that Edom's "shame" would be as extensive as their previous "pride"; it would be their new "habitation".</p></li>
<li><p>This "shame" is the "divine reality" check for their "violence," proving that their "mighty men" and "wise men" could not protect their "reputation" from the "Source of Truth".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 40:14:</strong> "Let them be ashamed and brought to mutual confusion... let them be driven backward and brought to <strong>shame (bušâ)</strong> who wish me evil."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 89:45:</strong> "...You have covered him with <strong>shame (bušâ)</strong>."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Micah 7:10:</strong> "Then she who is my enemy will see, and <strong>shame (bušâ)</strong> will cover her..."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>Shame is the "spiritual weight" of a life built on "empty talk" and "insubordinate" deeds. To avoid the "shame" of Edom, we must "walk" in "reverence" and "integrity," anchoring our "testimony" in the "Source of Truth". When we find our "soul prosperity" in the LORD, our "peace" becomes a "covering" that protects us from the "chaos" of the world.</p>
