<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>DESPISED — (<em>bāzâ</em>, Strong’s H959)</strong> Refers to regarding something with contempt, to hold in low esteem, or to treat as insignificant.</p>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 2</strong>, God declares that Edom shall be <strong>"greatly despised."</strong> This is the "divine reality" of their judgment: because they "despised" their brother Jacob and the "Source of Truth," they would, in turn, be stripped of their "preeminence" and looked upon with "contempt" by the very nations they once impressed.</p>
<p><strong>Full Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Word Study</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong’s H959:</strong> Meaning to disesteem, to disdain, or to hold in contempt.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Roots:</strong> A primary root meaning "to accord little worth to something".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TWOT Insight:</strong> The root <em>bāzâ</em> is often used in the context of "despising" sacred things or covenant relationships. It is the opposite of "honoring" or "valuing"; it is to treat something "weighty" as if it were "light" or worthless.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Usage in Hebrew Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Refuse Heap:</strong> Used to describe how one might treat garbage or something "unclean"—it is cast aside as having no "integrity" or value.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mocking Look:</strong> It carries the image of someone curling their lip in "disdain" at a fallen rival; for Edom, their "high habitation" would become a place of "shame".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mental Image:</strong> Think of a king’s crown being used as a common footstool; to be "despised" is to have your "reputation" and "status" utterly "emptied" of their former glory.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Theological Implications</strong></p>
<p>Being <strong>despised (H959)</strong> by God is the result of persistent "insubordinate" pride. It reflects the "integrity" of divine law: those who "despise" God's "special people" and His "saving health" will eventually find themselves "isolated" and "disdained". It proves that true "preeminence" only comes from God, and what man builds in "arrogance" can be made "insignificant" in an instant.</p>
<p><strong>4. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 2</strong></p>
<p>The NKJV says: <strong>"...You shall be greatly despised (bāzâ)."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a "reversal of fortune": Edom "despised" the "natural pressure points" of Israel’s suffering, and now the "nations" would "despise" Edom’s own "chaos".</p></li>
<li><p>The word "greatly" adds "spiritual weight" to the sentence, indicating a total and public "shaming" that leaves no room for their former "pride of heart".</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Genesis 25:34:</strong> "...Thus Esau <strong>despised (bāzâ)</strong> his birthright." (The root of Edom’s judgment).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Samuel 2:30:</strong> "...for those who honor Me I will honor, and those who <strong>despise (bāzâ)</strong> Me shall be lightly esteemed."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psalm 22:6:</strong> "But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and <strong>despised (bāzâ)</strong> by the people."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Insight</strong></p>
<p>We must be careful not to "despise" what God values. Whether it is our "brethren," our "testimony," or the "Source of Truth," treating holy things as "insignificant" is a "walk" toward our own "destruction". To find "soul prosperity," we must "honor" the LORD, choosing "reverence" over the "malicious" pride that leads to being "cut off".</p>
