<h2 id="summary">Summary </h2>
<p><strong>Pride (gaon, Strong’s H1347)</strong> is a deceptive, self-exalting confidence that shifts trust from God to false sources of security, convincing a person or nation that they are beyond accountability and therefore beyond judgment.</p>

<h3 id="hebrew-roots-derivation">1. Hebrew Roots / Derivation</h3>
<p><strong>Gaon (H1347)</strong> comes from a root meaning <em>to rise, be exalted, lifted up, elevated</em>.<br />
At its core, the word describes <strong>height or elevation</strong>, whether physical, social, or moral.<br />
Depending on context, it can describe <strong>legitimate majesty</strong> or <strong>sinful self-exaltation</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="meaning-definition">2. Meaning / Definition</h3>
<p>In <strong>Obadiah 1:3</strong>, <em>gaon</em> refers to <strong>inflated self-confidence rooted in perceived security</strong>.<br />
It is not mere arrogance of speech, but a settled belief that one’s position makes one <strong>safe from consequence</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="usage-in-biblical-context">3. Usage in Biblical Context</h3>
<p>In the prophets, <em>gaon</em> frequently describes <strong>national or corporate pride</strong>, especially when people trust in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>power</p></li>
<li><p>geography</p></li>
<li><p>military strength</p></li>
<li><p>political advantage</p></li>
</ul>
<p>rather than in the Lord (Isaiah 13:11; Jeremiah 48:29; Amos 6:8).</p>
<h3 id="theological-implications">4. Theological Implications</h3>
<p>Pride (<em>gaon</em>) is fundamentally <strong>a theological failure</strong>, not a personality flaw.<br />
It elevates created advantages into functional saviors and quietly displaces trust in God.<br />
Scripture consistently treats <em>gaon</em> as <strong>the condition that invites divine opposition</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="contextual-nuance-in-obadiah-13">5. Contextual Nuance in Obadiah 1:3</h3>
<p>Edom’s pride is expressed through:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>elevated geography (“clefts of the rock”)</p></li>
<li><p>strategic security</p></li>
<li><p>assumed invulnerability</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Their pride tells them that <strong>judgment has limits</strong>, and that God cannot reach where they are.<br />
This makes their pride <strong>deceptive rather than loud</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="key-uses-elsewhere-nkjv">6. Key Uses Elsewhere (NKJV)</h3>
<p><strong>Proverbs 16:18</strong><br />
<em>Pride goes before destruction,<br />
And a haughty spirit before a fall.</em> (NKJV)</p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah 49:16</strong> (parallel to Obadiah)<br />
<em>Your fierceness has deceived you,<br />
The pride of your heart…</em> (NKJV)</p>
<h3 id="other-relevant-insight">7. Other Relevant Insight</h3>
<p>In Obadiah, pride is not boasting.<br />
It is <strong>quiet confidence that God’s reach stops short of one’s defenses</strong>.</p>
