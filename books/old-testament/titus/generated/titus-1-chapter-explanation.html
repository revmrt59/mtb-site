<h2 id="paul-establishes-titus-authority-in-crete-titus-114">1. Paul Establishes TitusΓÇÖ Authority in Crete (Titus 1:1—4)</h2>
<p>Titus 1:1-4 Paul, a bondservant (G1401) of God and an apostle (G652) of Jesus Christ, according to the faith (G4102) of GodΓÇÖs elect (G1588) and the acknowledgment of the truth which accords with godliness (G2150), 2 in hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised (G1861) before time began, 3 but has in due time manifested His word through preaching (G2782), which was committed to me according to the commandment (G2003) of God our Savior; 4 To Titus, a true son in our common faith (G4102): Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. (NKJV)</p>
<p>In <strong>Titus 1:1—4 (NKJV)</strong></p>
<p>, the Apostle Paul establishes his authority and sets the theological stage for the rest of the letter. This salutation is one of Paul's longest, packed with foundational truths about faith, godliness, and the character of God. </p>
<p><strong>1. PaulΓÇÖs Identity and Mission (v. 1)</strong></p>
<p>Paul defines his life through two complementary titles: </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>"Bondservant of God":</strong> Using the Greek word <em>doulos</em> (slave), Paul emphasizes his total submission to God's will. It is a title of high honor used by Old Testament figures like Moses and David.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>"Apostle of Jesus Christ":</strong> This denotes his authority as a "sent one" commissioned directly by Christ to preach the Gospel. What he writes carries weight because it comes from a commission</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Purpose:</strong> His mission is focused on the <strong>"faith of God's elect"</strong> and the <strong>"acknowledgment of the truth"</strong>. Importantly, he notes that this truth "accords with godliness"—meaning right belief must always lead to right living. This truth is not just information. It is truth that leads to godliness, meaning a life that reflects obedience and reverence toward God. If belief does not show up in how people live, it has missed its purpose.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. The Foundation of Hope (v. 2—3)</strong></p>
<p>Paul shifts from his mission to the eternal security of the believer: </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>"Hope of Eternal Life":</strong> This is not a "wish" but a "confident assurance". It is based on the promise of <strong>"God, who cannot lie"</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Eternal Timing:</strong> This promise was made <strong>"before time began"</strong> but was <strong>"manifested"</strong> (revealed) at the proper time through the preaching of the Word. Paul views preaching as the divinely appointed tool for making this eternal plan known. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. The Greeting to Titus (v. 4)</strong></p>
<p>The passage concludes by addressing the recipient and offering a blessing: </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>"True Son in Our Common Faith":</strong> Paul likely led Titus to Christ, creating a spiritual father-son bond. By calling their faith "common," Paul highlights that the Gospel unifies all believers—Jew and Gentile alike—into one family.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Blessing:</strong> Paul offers <strong>"Grace, mercy, and peace"</strong> from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Savior Title:</strong> In verse 3, he calls God "our Savior," and in verse 4, he applies the same title to Christ. This highlights the <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-4.html"><u>divinity of Jesus</u></a> and the unity of the Trinity in the work of salvation. </p></li>

<h2 id="why-titus-was-left-in-crete-and-what-was-lacking-titus-15">2. Why Titus Was Left in Crete and What Was Lacking (Titus 1:5)</h2>
<p><em>Titus 1:5</em></p>
<p><em>ΓÇ£For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking (G3007), and appoint (G2525) elders (G4245) in every city as I commanded yo—ΓÇ¥</em> (NKJV)</p>
<p>In <strong>Titus 1:5 (NKJV)</strong>, Paul transitions from his theological greeting to the practical mission at hand. This verse serves as the "marching orders" for Titus and explains why he was left on the island of Crete.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Reason for the Mission: "Set in Order"</strong></p>
<p>Paul states, <strong>"For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>A Strategic Mandate:</strong> The Greek term for "set in order" (<em>epidiorthoì</em>) is a medical or architectural term meaning to "straighten further" or "correct what is crooked."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identifying the Deficits:</strong> "The things that are lacking" suggests that while churches had been planted in Crete, they were disorganized, lacked stable leadership, and were vulnerable to the false teachers described later in the chapter.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. The Solution: Appointing Elders</strong></p>
<p>The primary way Titus was to fix the disorder was to <strong>"appoint elders in every city."</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Plural Leadership:</strong> Paul emphasizes the need for <em>elders</em> (plural) in <em>every city</em>. The New Testament model for church governance consistently points toward a plurality of leadership to provide accountability and shared wisdom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Localized Authority:</strong> The church was not meant to be run from a distant headquarters; each local body of believers in every city needed its own qualified, resident leaders.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Apostolic Authority: "As I Commanded You"</strong></p>
<p>Paul concludes by reminding Titus that he isn't acting on his own whim but under <strong>apostolic instruction</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Blueprint:</strong> Titus was to follow the specific criteria Paul had previously discussed. This ensures that the leadership wasn't chosen based on popularity or wealth, but on the spiritual and moral qualifications Paul outlines in the verses that immediately follow.</p></li>

<h2 id="gods-design-for-church-leadership-qualified-elders-titus-169">3. GodΓÇÖs Design for Church Leadership: Qualified Elders (Titus 1:6—9)</h2>
<p><strong>Titus 1:6-9</strong> if a man is blameless (G410), the husband of one wife, having faithful (G4103) children not accused of dissipation or insubordination. 7 For a bishop must be blameless (G410), as a steward (G3623) of God, not self-willed (G829), not quick (G3711)-tempered, not given to wine (G3943), not violent, not greedy (G150) for money, 8 but hospitable (G5382), a lover of what is good (G5358) (G18), sober (G4998)-minded, just (G1342), holy (G3741), self-controlled (G1468), 9 holding fast (G472) the faithful (G4103) word as he has been taught, that he may be able (G1415), by sound (G1517) doctrine (G1319), both to exhort (G3870) and convict (G1651) those who contradict. (NKJV)</p>
<p>In <strong>Titus 1:6—9 (NKJV)</strong> , Paul provides a rigorous checklist for Titus to use when appointing elders. These requirements fall into three main categories: family life, personal character, and doctrinal conviction. </p>
<p><strong>1. Family Qualifications (v. 6)</strong></p>
<p>An elder's home is viewed as the "testing ground" for his leadership in the church. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Blameless:</strong> This is the overarching requirement, repeated in verse 7. It does not mean sinless, but rather that no legitimate charge of misconduct can be "stuck" to him. It means there is no ongoing pattern of life that undermines trust or brings reproach. An elderΓÇÖs life must not contradict the message he is responsible to guard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Husband of One Wife:</strong> Literally a "one-woman man". This requires absolute marital fidelity and moral purity; he must be a man of singular devotion to his wife.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Faithful Children:</strong> His children must not be known for <strong>"dissipation"</strong> (reckless, wasteful living) or <strong>"insubordination"</strong> (unruly rebellion). This demonstrates that he can successfully lead and shepherd those closest to him. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Personal Character (v. 7—8)</strong></p>
<p>Paul lists five negative traits to avoid and six positive traits to embrace, describing the elder as a <strong>"steward of God"</strong>—a manager of God's household. </p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>3. Doctrinal Conviction (v. 9)</strong></p>
<p>The final qualification is functional. An elder must <strong>"hold fast the faithful word"</strong> exactly as he has been taught. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Two-Fold Task:</strong> He must be skilled enough in "sound doctrine" to perform two duties:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Exhort:</strong> Encourage and build up the church with truth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Convict:</strong> Refute and silence those who contradict the truth. </p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key NKJV Terms to Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bishop (v. 7):</strong> Used interchangeably with "elder" (v. 5); it refers to the same office of oversight.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dissipation (v. 6):</strong> Refers to a wild, "profligate" lifestyle often associated with drunkenness and waste.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sober-minded (v. 8):</strong> Means more than just "not drunk"; it describes a man who is mentally stable and clear-thinking</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Meaning of the Phrase</strong></p>
<p>The Greek phrase <em>mias gynaikos andra</em> literally translates to a <strong>"one-woman man."</strong> While simple on the surface, it carries several layers of meaning regarding an elder's domestic life:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Moral Purity and Fidelity:</strong> The primary focus is the manΓÇÖs <strong>devotion</strong>. It describes a man who is entirely committed to his wife. He is not a womanizer, he does not flirt with others, and he is not involved in any form of sexual immorality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prohibiting Polygamy:</strong> In the first-century context, this explicitly barred anyone practicing polygamy from holding office in the church.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Question of Marital Status:</strong> Most scholars agree this does not <em>require</em> an elder to be married (otherwise, Paul himself would be disqualified). Rather, it means that <em>if</em> he is married, he must be a model of fidelity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Question of Divorce and Remarriage:</strong> There is significant debate on this. Some interpret it as "never divorced," while others argue it refers to a man's <strong>current</strong> character—meaning he is presently and consistently faithful to his wife. In any interpretation, the goal is a man whose marital life is blameless and above reproach.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why This Requirement?</strong></p>
<p>Paul places this first because the home is the <strong>proving ground</strong> for the church.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Leadership Consistency:</strong> If a man cannot keep his covenant with the person closest to him, he cannot be trusted to keep his covenant with the church.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Example to the Flock:</strong> The elder is meant to be a living template for the congregation. In a culture like Crete (known for "evil beasts" and "lazy gluttons"), a man with a stable, godly marriage stood out as a powerful witness to the Gospel's transforming power.</p></li>

<h2 id="the-danger-of-false-teachers-and-the-need-for-correction-titus-11016">4. The Danger of False Teachers and the Need for Correction (Titus 1:10—16)</h2>
<p><strong>The Danger of False Teachers and the Need for Correction (Titus 1:10—16)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Titus 1:10-16</strong></p>
<p>ΓÇ£For there are many insubordinate (G506) , both idle talkers (G3151 and deceivers (G5423) , especially those of the circumcision (G4061) , whose mouths must be stopped , who subvert (G396) whole households , teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of dishonest gain . One of them, a prophet of their own, said, ΓÇÿCretans are always liars , evil (G2556) beasts , lazy (G692) gluttons (G1043) .ΓÇÖ This testimony is true . Therefore rebuke (G1651) them sharply (G664) , that they may be sound (G1517) in the faith (G4102) , not giving heed (G4337) to Jewish fables and commandments (G1785) of men who turn from the truth . To the pure (G2513) all things are pure (G2513) , but to those who are defiled (G3392) and unbelieving nothing is pure (G2513) ; but even their mind (G3563) and conscience (G4893) are defiled (G3392) . They profess (G3670) to know God, but in works they deny (G720) Him, being abominable (G947) , disobedient (G545) , and disqualified (G96) for every good (G18) work (G2041) .ΓÇ¥ (NKJV)</p>
<p>Titus 1:10—16 is a stern warning from the Apostle Paul to Titus regarding the threat of <strong>false teachers</strong> on the island of Crete. Paul provides a detailed profile of these individuals and instructs Titus on how to protect the church from their influence. </p>
<p><strong>1. Identifying the False Teachers (v. 10—12)</strong></p>
<p>Paul describes these individuals not as misguided outsiders, but as rebellious insiders. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Character Traits:</strong> He calls them rebellious (insubordinate), "idle talkers," and "deceivers". They are characterized by a refusal to submit to biblical authority and a tendency to use many words that lack spiritual substance but sound convincing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The "Circumcision:</strong> Paul specifically identifies "those of the circumcision" as the primary problem. These were likely <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-10.html"><u>Judaizers</u></a> who insisted that Gentile Christians must follow the Mosaic Law, specifically circumcision, to be truly saved or sanctified.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Motive and Impact:</strong> Their primary motivation was <strong>"dishonest gain"</strong> (dishonest financial profit). Their teaching was so destructive that it was subverting i.e. "upsetting, whole families, likely by causing deep division or leading them back into a life of legalistic bondage or possibly causing financial hardship.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. The Command to Silence and Rebuke (v. 13—14)</strong></p>
<p>Paul gives Titus a clear, two-fold directive for handling this threat. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Silence them:</strong> Paul states that these teachers <strong>"must be silenced"</strong>. The Greek word used (<em>epistomizì</em>) literally means to "bridle" or "gag," implying that they must be denied any platform to speak within the church.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rebuke them:</strong> Titus is told to <strong>"rebuke them sharply"</strong>. This wasn't meant to be mean-spirited but corrective. The goal was for them to become "soundΓÇ¥ or healthy in the faith" by turning away from "Jewish myths and the commandments of men". </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. The Root of the Problem: Defiled and Unbelieving Hearts (v. 15—16) </strong></p>
<p>Paul concludes by exposing the spiritual state of these teachers, contrasting them with true believers. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Purity vs. Defilement:</strong> He famously writes, <strong>"To the pure, all things are pure"</strong>. For those cleansed by Christ, external rituals (like dietary laws) do not define holiness. Conversely, for the defiled and unbelieving, even their religious acts are tainted because their <strong>minds and consciences</strong> are corrupted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deeds vs. Words:</strong> The final verse provides a definitive test: "They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him". Paul labels them "detestable, disobedient, and disqualified for any good deed" because their outward lives contradict their verbal profession of faith. </p></li>
