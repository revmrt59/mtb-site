<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>didask┼ì</em> (to teach). It refers to the <strong>content</strong> of what is taught. While <em>didach─ô</em> often refers to the <em>act</em> of teaching, <em>didaskalia</em> usually denotes the established <strong>body of truth</strong> itself. Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Instruction, precept, or information. In the Pastoral Epistles, it specifically refers to the "standard of teaching" or the "apostolic deposit." It is the objective set of truths that defines the boundaries of the Christian faith. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The MasterΓÇÖs Syllabus:</strong> In Greek schools, <em>didaskalia</em> was the <strong>official curriculum</strong> provided by a master philosopher to his students. It wasn't a collection of random ideas, but a structured "path" of learning. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Blueprint:</strong> A word picture associated with it is a <strong>master architect's blueprint</strong>. The "doctrine" provides the specifications for how the "house" (the church) is to be built; if the builder deviates from the blueprint, the house becomes unstable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Food Supply:</strong> It evokes the image of <strong>provisions for a journey</strong>. Just as a traveler needs "sound" food to survive the trip, the believer needs "sound doctrine" to navigate the spiritual journey toward eternal life. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Doctrine is the "backbone" of the Christian life. Without it, faith becomes mere sentiment. Because God is the Author of truth, His "doctrine" is absolute and unchangeable. It is the "good deposit" (2 Tim 1:14) that must be guarded. In Titus, doctrine is never just "head knowledge"; it is the essential foundation for "godliness" (v. 1) and "separation" to God.

<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:9</strong><br />
The <strong>NKJV</strong> says: <em>"...that he may be able, by <strong>sound doctrine</strong> (didaskalia)..."</em> Paul links doctrine directly to "soundness" (health). In Crete, the "circumcision group" (v. 10) was teaching "commandments of men" (v. 14). PaulΓÇÖs solution is to return to the <strong>Apostolic Doctrine</strong>. The elderΓÇÖs power to "exhort" and "convict" comes entirely from his ability to handle this "faithful Word" accurately. <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a> </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 4:16:</strong> "Take heed to yourself and to the <strong>doctrine</strong> (<em>didaskalia</em>). Continue in them..." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 3:16:</strong> "All Scripture is... profitable for <strong>doctrine</strong> (<em>didaskalia</em>)..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Titus 2:10:</strong> "...that they may adorn the <strong>doctrine</strong> (<em>didaskalia</em>) of God our Savior in all things." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />

<p>Godly Living. If the doctrine is corrupted, the lifestyle (works) will eventually be "abominable" (v. 16). The elder is the "gatekeeper" of this doctrine, ensuring that the "food" of the church remains pure. Precept Austin </p>
