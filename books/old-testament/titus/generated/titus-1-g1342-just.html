<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>dikô</em> (right, custom, or a judicial verdict). It refers to that which is "proper" or in accordance with an established standard of law or morality. Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Upright, righteous, or virtuous. It describes a person who gives to everyone their due—whether it be honor to God or fairness to a neighbor. In the New Testament, it characterizes one whose life is in harmony with the divine will. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Equal Scale:</strong> In the Greek marketplace, <em>dikaios</em> described a merchant whose <strong>scales were perfectly balanced</strong>. He did not cheat or show favoritism; he was "just" because he gave the exact weight promised. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Straight Path:</strong> A word picture associated with it is a <strong>surveyorΓÇÖs line</strong>. It describes something that does not deviate to the left or the right but follows the "straight edge" of the law.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Impartial Judge:</strong> It evokes the image of a <strong>judge who cannot be bribed</strong>. He does not look at the status of the person but at the "rightness" of the case. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
God is the ultimate "Just" One (<em>Ho Dikaios</em>). For a leader to be "just," he must reflect God's impartiality and holiness. Since the elder is a "steward" (v. 7), he must handle the MasterΓÇÖs business with total integrity. A "just" leader protects the church from the "dishonest gain" (v. 11) of the false teachers by modeling a life of transparent righteousness. BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:8</strong><br />
The <strong>NKJV</strong> says: <em>"...sober-minded, <strong>just</strong> (dikaios), holy..."</em> Paul uses this to counter the "Cretan reputation." Cretans were "always liars" (v. 12); therefore, a "just" man was a living miracle in that society. An elderΓÇÖs <strong>fairness</strong> was essential for "setting in order" the church (v. 5), as he would have to make difficult decisions about discipline and doctrine without showing favoritism. <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a> </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Matthew 1:19:</strong> "Then Joseph her husband, being a <strong>just</strong> (<em>dikaios</em>) man..." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 John 1:9:</strong> "...He is faithful and <strong>just</strong> (<em>dikaios</em>) to forgive us our sins..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Romans 1:17:</strong> "...as it is written, 'The <strong>just</strong> (<em>dikaios</em>) shall live by faith.'" </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a distinction between "Just" and "Holy": </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Just (<em>Dikaios</em>):</strong> Rightness in relation to <strong>men</strong> (fairness/integrity).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Holy (<em>Hosios</em>):</strong> Rightness in relation to <strong>God</strong> (devotion/purity).<br />
Together, they describe a leader who is "rightly related" in every direction—upward to Heaven and outward to his community. Precept Austin </p></li>
