<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
The present participle of <em>hygi─ôs</em> (whole, healthy). It is the root of the English word "hygiene." Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
To be in good health; to be well. Metaphorically, it refers to being uncorrupt in oneΓÇÖs judgment or "safe and sound" in one's doctrine. It describes a teaching that is "health-giving" rather than "sickly" or toxic. Thayer's Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Medical Report:</strong> In Greek culture, this was the standard <strong>medical term</strong> used by physicians (like Luke) to describe a body that was functioning exactly as it was designed to. A person who was <em>hygiain┼ì</em> was fit for service and free from infection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Balanced Diet:</strong> Philosophers like Socrates used the word to describe <strong>"healthy" ideas</strong>. Just as bad food makes the body sick, "sick" ideas (myths and lies) make the soul weak and lethargic. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Structural Foundation:</strong> In architecture, it was occasionally used for a <strong>sound structure</strong>—one that was not decaying, rotting, or compromised by "dry rot." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Paul uses this word almost exclusively in his letters to Timothy and Titus to contrast the Gospel with false teaching. Error is viewed as a <strong>spiritual disease</strong> (like gangrene) that spreads and destroys. Therefore, "Sound Doctrine" is the "medicine" that restores the soul to its proper, God-intended health. You cannot live a healthy Christian life on a "diet" of false teaching. </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:13</strong><br />
The "sharp rebuke" mentioned earlier has a restorative goal: "that they may be <strong>sound</strong> (<em>hygiain┼ì</em>) in the faith." Paul is saying that the false teachers and the Cretans were <strong>spiritually sick</strong>. The rebuke wasn't a punishment; it was a "surgical strike" intended to cut out the infection of "Jewish myths" so that their faith could become vibrant and "healthy" once again. </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 1:10:</strong> "...and if there is any other thing that is contrary to <strong>sound</strong> (<em>hygiain┼ì</em>) doctrine."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 4:3:</strong> "For the time will come when they will not endure <strong>sound</strong> (<em>hygiain┼ì</em>) doctrine..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Titus 2:1:</strong> "But as for you, speak the things which are proper for <strong>sound</strong> (<em>hygiain┼ì</em>) doctrine."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3 John 1:2:</strong> "Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in <strong>health</strong> (<em>hygiain┼ì</em>), just as your soul prospers." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
In Crete, the culture was "sick" with lying and laziness. PaulΓÇÖs strategy was not "cultural reform," but "doctrinal health." He believed that if you get the <strong>doctrine sound</strong>, the <strong>behavior</strong> will eventually follow. "Healthy" teaching always produces "healthy" living. BibleRef </p>
