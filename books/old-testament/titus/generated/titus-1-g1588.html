<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>ek</em> (out of) + <em>leg┼ì</em> (to pick or choose). It literally means "the chosen ones" or "the picked-out ones." Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Chosen, select, or the best of its kind. It describes someone or something that has been singled out from a larger group based on the will and criteria of the one doing the choosing. In a theological sense, it refers to those whom God has chosen for Himself through Christ. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Hand-Picked Fruit:</strong> In the ancient marketplace, <em>eklektos</em> was used for <strong>premium goods</strong>—the "choice" produce that was set aside as the best of the harvest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Elite Troops:</strong> In military contexts, it described <strong>picked soldiers</strong>—the "special forces" or elite guards chosen for their loyalty and skill to serve the King. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Selected Stone:</strong> It was used for <strong>choice building stones</strong> that were carefully selected by a master builder because they were fit for the foundation or the cornerstone. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Election is a "family" term in the New Testament. It reminds the believer that they did not find God, but God found them. It is meant to produce <strong>humility and security</strong>: humility because the choice was based on God's grace, not our merit; and security because God's "choice" is not easily revoked. It shifts the focus from human performance to divine purpose. </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:1</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"...according to the faith of <strong>GodΓÇÖs elect</strong> (eklektos)..."</em> Paul uses this term to define the scope of his mission. He isn't trying to create a new philosophy for everyone; he is a servant to the specific people God has called. By identifying the Cretan believers as "elect," Paul is giving them an incredible sense of <strong>dignity</strong>. Though the world saw them as "liars and beasts" (v. 12), God saw them as His "choice" people. BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Romans 8:33:</strong> "Who shall bring a charge against <strong>GodΓÇÖs elect</strong> (<em>eklektos</em>)? It is God who justifies."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Colossians 3:12:</strong> "Therefore, as the <strong>elect</strong> (<em>eklektos</em>) of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Peter 2:9:</strong> "But you are a <strong>chosen</strong> (<em>eklektos</em>) generation, a royal priesthood..." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
Election and "the faith" are inseparable in this verse. Paul doesn't view election as an excuse for laziness, but as a reason for <strong>evangelism and teaching</strong>. He works hard as an apostle <em>because</em> he knows there are "elect" people whose faith needs to be furthered and whose knowledge of the truth needs to be matured. </p>
