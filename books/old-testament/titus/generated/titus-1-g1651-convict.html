Refers to the act of exposing, refuting, or bringing a person to the point of recognizing their error by presenting undeniable evidence. In <strong>Titus 1:9</strong>, it identifies the elderΓÇÖs duty to use "sound doctrine" to dismantle the arguments of those who oppose the truth, leaving them without excuse. Blue Letter Bible </p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A primary verb (<em>elegchì</em>) signifying to find fault with, to correct, or to bring to light. It is a judicial term that moves beyond mere criticism to a definitive proof of wrongdoing. Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
To convict, to refute, or to manifest a person's fault. It describes an intentional confrontation where truth is used to peel back the layers of deception until the sin or error is laid bare. It implies not just "telling" someone they are wrong, but "proving" it to them. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Courtroom Cross-Examiner:</strong> In Athenian law, <em>elegchì</em> was the process of <strong>cross-examining a witness</strong> to expose their lies and establish the truth. The goal was to reach a "proof" that could not be argued against in court. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Illuminating Lamp:</strong> In Greek literature, it was used for <strong>bringing a hidden object into the light</strong>. The word picture is of a dark room where someone has hidden filth; the "conviction" is the act of turning on a bright lamp so the dirt can no longer be ignored or denied.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mirror of Truth:</strong> Philosophers used it to describe a "moral mirror." Just as a mirror forces a person to see the blemish on their face, <em>elegchì</em> forces the soul to see its own "beastly" (v. 12) behavior. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Conviction is a primary work of both the <strong>Word of God</strong> and the <strong>Holy Spirit</strong>. Jesus promised that the Spirit would "convict (<em>elegchì</em>) the world of sin" (John 16:8). In the church, it is the "sharp" edge of the elder's authority. Because the elder is "separated" (<em>hagios</em>) to God, he must be a "truth-teller" who exposes the "unfruitful works of darkness" (Eph 5:11). BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:9</strong><br />
The <strong>NKJV</strong> says: <em>"...both to exhort and <strong>convict</strong> (elegchì) those who contradict."</em> This is the "defensive" work of the elder. In Crete, the "circumcision group" (v. 10) was spreading "Jewish fables." The elder had to be "able" (v. 9) to use the Word as a surgical tool to "convict" these teachers—effectively silencing their lies by exposing their logical and spiritual bankruptcy. <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>John 16:8:</strong> "And when He has come, He will <strong>convict</strong> (<em>elegchì</em>) the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ephesians 5:11:</strong> "And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather <strong>expose</strong> (<em>elegchì</em>) them."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 4:2:</strong> "Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. <strong>Convince</strong> (<em>elegchì</em>), rebuke, exhort..." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a profound purpose in this "convicting": it is meant to lead to the <strong>restoration</strong> mentioned in verse 13 ("that they may be sound in the faith"). A biblical conviction is not a "death sentence" but an "eviction notice" for sin. It clears the "mind" (<em>nous</em>) of fables so that the "knowledge of the truth" (v. 1) can take root. Precept Austin </p>

<p><strong>SOUND</strong> — (<em>hygiainì</em>, StrongΓÇÖs G1517)<br />
Refers to a state of being healthy, whole, or free from disease. In <strong>Titus 1:9</strong>, it describes doctrine that is "spiritually hygienic"—meaning it is uncorrupted by error and possesses the life-giving power to produce vitality and moral health in those who hear it. Blue Letter Bible </p>
<h2 id="full-study-1">Full Study: </h2>
<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
The present participle of <em>hygiôs</em> (whole, healthy). It is the direct etymological root of the English word "hygiene." Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
To be in good health; to be well. Metaphorically, it refers to being uncorrupt in oneΓÇÖs judgment or "safe and sound" in one's teaching. It characterizes doctrine that is "health-giving" rather than "sickly," "toxic," or "decaying." ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Medical Report:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>hygiainì</em> was the standard <strong>medical term</strong> for a body functioning exactly as designed. A person who was <em>hygiainì</em> was fit for service and free from infection. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Balanced Diet:</strong> Philosophers used the word to describe <strong>"healthy" ideas</strong>. Just as rotten food makes the body sick, "sickly" ideas (like the fables in v. 14) make the soul weak and lethargic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Sound Structure:</strong> In architecture, it was used for a <strong>building with no rot</strong>. A "sound" structure can withstand a storm; a "diseased" structure collapses under pressure. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Paul uses this word almost exclusively in the Pastoral Epistles to contrast the Gospel with false teaching. Error is viewed as a <strong>spiritual disease</strong> (like gangrene) that spreads and destroys. Therefore, "Sound Doctrine" is the "medicine" that restores the soul to its proper, God-intended health. It implies that what we believe directly impacts our spiritual "immune system." BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:9</strong><br />
The <strong>NKJV</strong> says: <em>"...that he may be able, by <strong>sound</strong> (hygiainì) doctrine, both to exhort and convict..."</em> This is the elder's "pharmacy." In Crete, the culture was "sick" with lying and gluttony. PaulΓÇÖs strategy was not "cultural reform," but "doctrinal health." He believed that if you get the <strong>doctrine sound</strong>, the <strong>behavior</strong> will eventually follow. <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a> </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 1:10:</strong> "...and if there is any other thing that is contrary to <strong>sound</strong> (<em>hygiainì</em>) doctrine." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 4:3:</strong> "For the time will come when they will not endure <strong>sound</strong> (<em>hygiainì</em>) doctrine..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Titus 2:1:</strong> "But as for you, speak the things which are proper for <strong>sound</strong> (<em>hygiainì</em>) doctrine." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a direct link between "Sound Doctrine" and the <strong>"Separation"</strong> (<em>hagios</em>) you noted earlier. Healthy doctrine produces a life that is "separated" from the filth of the world. In Titus 1:13, the goal of a "sharp rebuke" is to make the person "sound in the faith." The Truth is the only "disinfectant" that can clear the "defilement" (v. 15) of a Cretan heart. Precept Austin </p>
