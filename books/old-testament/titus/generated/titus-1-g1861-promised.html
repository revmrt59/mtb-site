<p><strong>PROMISED</strong> — (<em>epangellomai</em>, StrongΓÇÖs <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1861/kjv/tr/0-1/"><u>G1861</u></a>)<br />
Refers to a voluntary, self-binding declaration to perform a specific act or provide a specific benefit. In the context of Titus 1:2, it describes GodΓÇÖs pre-temporal decree to grant eternal life, a commitment that is as unchangeable as His own nature. </p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A compound verb from <em>epi</em> (upon/fitting) and the base of <em>aggelos</em> (to announce or bring a message). It literally means "to announce upon" or to declare a message that is legitimately applicable to a specific situation. </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
To announce that one is about to do or furnish something; to engage voluntarily or of oneΓÇÖs own accord. In the New Testament, it is used almost exclusively for the <strong>unilateral pledges of God</strong> which require no human negotiation and carry the weight of an absolute guarantee. </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Political Platform:</strong> In secular Greek culture, <em>epangellomai</em> was often used for <strong>promises made by politicians</strong> or those seeking office. Unlike human politicians whose promises can fail, GodΓÇÖs <em>epangellomai</em> is cited as the ultimate contrast because He "cannot lie".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Professional Claim:</strong> It was used for <strong>professing an art or skill</strong> (e.g., a physician "promising" a cure or an orator "promising" wisdom). God is the ultimate "Professional" who claims the power to grant life and perfectly delivers on that claim.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Voluntary Bond:</strong> A word picture associated with it is a <strong>self-signed contract</strong>. It describes a person who, without any outside pressure, writes their own check and signs their own name, making themselves a "debtor" to their own word. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
GodΓÇÖs promise is the bedrock of Christian assurance. Because it is a <strong>voluntary self-committal</strong>, it depends entirely on the character of the Promiser. In theology, this is often called the "Covenant of Redemption"—a promise made within the Trinity before any human existed to ask for it. It moves salvation from the realm of "maybe" into the realm of "it is finished." </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:2</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"...which God, who cannot lie, <strong>promised</strong> (epangellomai) before time began."</em> Paul is reminding Titus that the "hope" they are preaching is not a new invention. By using a word that implies a voluntary, pre-temporal pledge, Paul shows that eternal life was <strong>God's idea first</strong>. This was a powerful comfort in Crete, where human promises were notoriously worthless. </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Romans 4:21:</strong> "...and being fully convinced that what He had <strong>promised</strong> (<em>epangellomai</em>) He was also able to do."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hebrews 10:23:</strong> "Let us hold fast the confession of our hope... for He who <strong>promised</strong> (<em>epangellomai</em>) is faithful."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>James 1:12:</strong> "...he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has <strong>promised</strong> (<em>epangellomai</em>) to those who love Him." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
This word is the active "engine" behind the noun <em>epangelia</em> (promise). While the noun describes the <em>gift</em> itself, the verb <em>epangellomai</em> emphasizes the <strong>act of the Promiser</strong>. In Titus 1:2, the emphasis is not just on "Eternal Life," but on the fact that <strong>God specifically spoke it into existence</strong> as a binding decree before the world was even made. </p>
