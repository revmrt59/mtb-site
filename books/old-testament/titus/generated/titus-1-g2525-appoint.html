<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The ShipΓÇÖs Landing:</strong> In classical Greek, it was used for <strong>bringing a ship to land</strong> or "setting it down" at its destination. The word picture is of a vessel reaching its proper station where it can finally be useful. <a href="https://www.preceptaustin.org/titus_15-9"><u>Precept Austin</u></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Royal Steward:</strong> It was used to describe a king <strong>putting a servant in charge</strong> of his house or kingdom (e.g., Joseph in Egypt). It isn't just about "giving a job," but about "transferring authority." <a href="https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/eng/bnb/titus-1.html"><u>StudyLight</u></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Courtroom Escort:</strong> It was also used for <strong>conducting or escorting</strong> someone to a certain place or before a magistrate (Acts 17:15). It implies a "hand-off" from one authority to another. Blue Letter Bible </p></li>

<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
God is the ultimate source of all appointment. While humans (like Titus) perform the physical act, the <em>kathistômi</em> reflects GodΓÇÖs own sovereign arrangement of the church. It reminds us that leadership is not a "volunteer" position but a <strong>divine placement</strong>. Those "appointed" are stewards of GodΓÇÖs household, accountable to the Master who set them there. <a href="https://hbcharlesjr.com/resource-library/sermon-outlines/appointing-qualified-elders-titus-15-9/"><u>H.B. Charles Jr.</u></a> </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:5</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"...and <strong>appoint</strong> (kathistômi) elders in every city..."</em> Paul authorized Titus to take the "straightening out" (v. 5) to its logical conclusion by installing local leadership. Because the Cretan culture was "insubordinate" (v. 10), these appointments had to be <strong>permanent and official</strong> to provide the weight necessary to stop false teachers. <a href="https://bibleproject.com/guides/book-of-titus/"><u>Bible Project</u></a> </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Matthew 24:45:</strong> "Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his master <strong>made ruler</strong> (<em>kathistômi</em>) over his household...?" NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acts 6:3:</strong> "...men of good reputation... whom we may <strong>appoint</strong> (<em>kathistômi</em>) over this business."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hebrews 5:1:</strong> "For every high priest... is <strong>appointed</strong> (<em>kathistômi</em>) for men in things pertaining to God..." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
In the New Testament, <em>kathistômi</em> is often used in the <strong>Passive Voice</strong> regarding the High Priesthood (Hebrews 5:1, 8:3), indicating that leaders do not appoint themselves. In Titus, the authority flows from Christ to Paul, from Paul to Titus, and from Titus to the elders—a clear chain of stewardship. Precept Austin </p>
