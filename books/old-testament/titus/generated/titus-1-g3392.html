<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A primary verb (<em>miain┼ì</em>) meaning to dye with another color, and thus to stain, pollute, or contaminate. </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
To tinge or dye; to pollute, contaminate, or soil. In the New Testament, it is used exclusively in a moral and religious sense to describe the "soiling" of the soul and conscience that makes a person unfit for the presence of a holy God. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Stained Ivory:</strong> In HomerΓÇÖs <em>Iliad</em>, this word was used to describe <strong>ivory stained with purple dye</strong>. The ivory is not "dirty" in a physical sense, but its natural white color has been permanently altered by the dye.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The MurdererΓÇÖs Miasma:</strong> In Greek tragedies, a murderer was said to have "defiled" (<em>miain┼ì</em>) the city. The crime was believed to create a <strong>poisonous atmosphere</strong> or a "miasma" that brought plague and disaster until it was purged. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Permanent Marker:</strong> The word picture is of <strong>permanent ink</strong> on a white garment. It isn't just surface dust that can be shaken off; the "dye" has permeated the fibers of the mind and conscience. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Defilement in the New Testament is an <strong>internal condition</strong> that precedes external actions. Paul argues that "nothing is pure" to the defiled person because their "internal filter" is broken. Because they reject God and his Truth, their perceptions are twisted. Even their "religious" acts (like the fables and commandments of men) are "stained" by their own inner corruption. </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:15</strong><br />
The NKJV states: <em>"but to those who are <strong>defiled</strong> (miain┼ì) and unbelieving nothing is pure."</em> This is the mirror image of the first half of the verse. Paul is exposing the hypocrisy of the false teachers: they worried about being "defiled" by certain foods or unwashed hands, yet Paul says they were already <strong>permanently stained</strong> in their minds and consciences by their rebellion against God. </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>John 18:28:</strong> "...and they themselves did not go into the Praetorium, lest they should be <strong>defiled</strong> (<em>miain┼ì</em>)..." (The irony of religious leaders fearing ritual defilement while murdering Christ).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hebrews 12:15:</strong> "...lest any root of bitterness springing up cause trouble, and by this many become <strong>defiled</strong> (<em>miain┼ì</em>)."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jude 1:8:</strong> "...these dreamers <strong>defile</strong> (<em>miain┼ì</em>) the flesh, reject authority, and speak evil of dignitaries." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
The word is used here in the <strong>Perfect Passive Participle</strong> (<em>memiammenois</em>), which indicates a <strong>completed action with ongoing results</strong>. This isn't a momentary mistake; it describes a "settled state" of pollution. Their minds have been "dyed" by sin to the point that they can no longer see things as they truly are. </p>
