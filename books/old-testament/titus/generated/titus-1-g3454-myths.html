<p><strong>MYTHS</strong> — (<em>mythos</em>, StrongΓÇÖs G3454)<br />
Refers to speech, stories, or fables that lack a foundation in objective reality. In the New Testament, it characterizes man-made religious "mysteries" or legends that serve to distract from the truth and foster useless speculation rather than spiritual growth. </p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
From the primary root <em>mu-</em> (to mutter or murmur). It evolved from meaning "a word/speech" to meaning a "fable" or "legend"—specifically one that is fictional or deceptive in nature. </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
A tale, a fable, or a fiction. In a biblical context, it refers to religious stories or "extra-biblical" traditions that are substituted for the actual Word of God. It describes that which is fabricated as opposed to that which is historical or divinely revealed. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The ActorΓÇÖs Script:</strong> In Greek drama, <em>mythos</em> was the <strong>plot or the "story"</strong> of a play. It was understood by the audience to be a performance—it was "art," not "truth."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Nursery Tale:</strong> It was often used for <strong>stories told to children</strong> to keep them entertained or to frighten them into behaving. Paul uses this nuance in 1 Timothy 4:7, calling them "old wives' fables." Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Counterfeit Map:</strong> The word picture is of a <strong>fictional map</strong> of a real city. While it might look detailed and impressive, it will lead the traveler into a dead end because it does not correspond to the actual terrain. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
A <em>mythos</em> is dangerous because it often contains a "kernel" of religious vocabulary but lacks the power of the Spirit. Paul contrasts "myths" with "truth." While truth sanctifies and builds "soundness" (v. 13), myths produce only "meaningless talk" (v. 10) and "disputes" (1 Tim 1:4). They cater to human curiosity and the desire for "secret knowledge" rather than the simple obedience of faith. </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:14</strong><br />
Paul specifically identifies these as <strong>"Jewish myths."</strong> This likely refers to the "Haggadah"—fanciful, legendary expansions of Old Testament stories or genealogies common in the first century. The false teachers used these myths to sound "deeper" than Titus, effectively "mind-deceiving" the Cretans by replacing the clear Gospel with religious "fan-fiction" and legalistic rules.

<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>2 Peter 1:16:</strong> "For we did not follow cunningly devised <strong>fables</strong> (<em>mythos</em>) when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 1:4:</strong> "...nor give heed to <strong>fables</strong> (<em>mythos</em>) and endless genealogies, which cause disputes..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 4:4:</strong> "...and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to <strong>fables</strong> (<em>mythos</em>)." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
The "myths" are linked to the <strong>"commandments of men."</strong> Because myths have no divine authority, they always result in human-made rules to sustain them. To stay "sound in the faith," the believer must be a "truth-dweller," refusing to let their mind be occupied by religious "mysteries" that have no basis in the finished work of Christ. </p>
