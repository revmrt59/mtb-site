<p><strong>PROFESS</strong> — (<em>homologe┼ì</em>, StrongΓÇÖs G3670)<br />
Refers to the act of making an open, public declaration or acknowledgment. In this context, it describes a formal verbal claim to know God that is tragically contradicted by the actual evidence of the personΓÇÖs life. </p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>homou</em> (together/same) + <em>leg┼ì</em> (to speak). It literally means "to speak the same thing" or "to agree." Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
To say the same thing as another; to concede, promise, or declare. In the New Testament, it often refers to a public "confession" of faith. It implies that the speaker is aligning their words with a specific standard or person. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Legal Contract:</strong> In secular Greek life, <em>homologe┼ì</em> was a <strong>legal term for a formal agreement</strong>. When two parties "spoke the same thing," they entered into a binding contract. To "profess" was to sign your name to a statement of fact.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Courtroom Admission:</strong> It was used for <strong>pleading guilty or admitting a fact</strong> in court. The defendant "agreed" with the charges brought against them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Echo:</strong> A word picture is that of an <strong>echo</strong>. When God speaks a truth, the believer "echoes" it back through their <em>homologe┼ì</em>. However, the false teachers were "echoing" words they didn't actually believe or follow. Precept Austin </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Confession is central to salvation (Romans 10:9). We are called to "profess" Christ before men. However, <em>homologe┼ì</em> is intended to be the <strong>outward expression of an inward reality</strong>. When there is a "disconnect" between the profession and the personΓÇÖs character, the profession becomes a form of "empty talk" (v. 10) that God rejects. </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:16</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"They <strong>profess</strong> (homologe┼ì) to know God, but in works they deny Him."</em> Paul exposes the ultimate hypocrisy: the false teachers used "God-talk" as a mask. They agreed with the <em>vocabulary</em> of faith but rejected the <em>authority</em> of God. Their "echo" was hollow; they spoke the right words but lived the wrong life. BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Romans 10:9:</strong> "...that if you <strong>confess</strong> (<em>homologe┼ì</em>) with your mouth the Lord Jesus... you will be saved."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 John 1:9:</strong> "If we <strong>confess</strong> (<em>homologe┼ì</em>) our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Matthew 10:32:</strong> "Therefore whoever <strong>confesses</strong> (<em>homologe┼ì</em>) Me before men, him I will also confess before My Father..." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
This "profession" is the "sheepΓÇÖs clothing" that hides the "beastly" nature (v. 12). Because they "professed" to know God, they were able to gain access to the "households" they were upsetting. Paul warns that a verbal profession is worthless if it is not validated by the "fruit" of godliness. </p>
