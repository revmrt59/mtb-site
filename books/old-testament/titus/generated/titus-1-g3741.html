<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A primary word (<em>hosios</em>) of uncertain affinity. It refers to that which is sanctioned by divine law and has a deep connection to religious duty and internal purity. Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Undefiled by sin, free from wickedness, and religiously pure. While <em>hagios</em> (another word for holy) often refers to being "set apart" for a task, <em>hosios</em> focuses on the <strong>inward quality</strong> of a personΓÇÖs relationship with God—their "heart-piety" and personal devotion. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Unpolluted Stream:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>hosios</em> was used for <strong>water that was ceremonially clean</strong> and fit for use in a temple. It describes a life that is free from the "mud" and "sediment" of worldly corruption. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Upright Altar:</strong> A word picture associated with it is a <strong>private altar</strong> in a home. It represents the "secret life" of prayer and devotion that happens when no one else is watching.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Untainted Hand:</strong> It evokes the image of <strong>"lifting up holy hands"</strong> (1 Tim 2:8)—hands that are clean because they have not been involved in "dishonest gain" or "evil" deeds. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
God is the "Holy One" (<em>Ho Hosios</em>). For a leader to be <em>hosios</em>, he must have a conscience that is clear before God. This is the <strong>spiritual engine</strong> of his ministry. Since the elder must "refute" (v. 9) those who are "defiled" (v. 15), his own life must be a "holy" contrast. Holiness is the internal shield that protects the "Steward of God" from the "beastly" culture around him. BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:8</strong><br />
The <strong>NKJV</strong> says: <em>"...just, <strong>holy</strong> (hosios), self-controlled..."</em> Paul uses this to address the "Cretan virus." The Cretans were "defiled" in their minds and consciences (v. 15). By requiring the elder to be <em>hosios</em>, Paul is demanding a man whose <strong>inner life is healthy</strong>. If he is not "holy," his "profession" (v. 16) is just empty talk. <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a> </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 2:8:</strong> "...lifting up <strong>holy</strong> (<em>hosios</em>) hands, without wrath and doubting." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acts 13:35:</strong> "...You will not allow Your <strong>Holy</strong> (<em>hosios</em>) One to see corruption." (Referring to Christ).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hebrews 7:26:</strong> "For such a High Priest was fitting for us, who is <strong>holy</strong> (<em>hosios</em>), harmless, undefiled..." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a profound distinction between <em>hosios</em> and <em>dikaios</em> (Just): </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Just (<em>Dikaios</em>):</strong> Righteousness in his <strong>horizontal</strong> duties toward men.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Holy (<em>Hosios</em>):</strong> Righteousness in his <strong>vertical</strong> duties toward God.<br />
A man who is "just" but not "holy" is merely a moralist; a man who is "holy" but not "just" is a hypocrite. The elder must be both. Precept Austin </p></li>
