<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A compound word from <em>para</em> (beside) + <em>oinos</em> (wine). It literally means "one who sits long beside his wine" or "one who stays near the wine-cup." Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Addicted to wine; drunken, or abusive under the influence. It identifies more than just an occasional drink; it points to a <strong>fixed habit</strong> or a lifestyle where alcohol is a constant companion, leading to "tipsy" arrogance and verbal or physical aggression. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Tavern Brawler:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>paroinos</em> was often used for the <strong>violent drunkard</strong> who picks fights. It evokes the image of a "brawl at a banquet" where wine has removed the "governor" of civilized behavior. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The "Furniture" of the Pub:</strong> A word picture associated with it is a man who is as much a part of the tavern as the <strong>tables and benches</strong>. He is always "beside the wine," never far enough away to be sober and vigilant.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Compromised Watchman:</strong> It describes a <strong>sentry who drinks on duty</strong>. Because his senses are dulled, he cannot "oversee" (<em>episkopos</em>) anything effectively. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Leadership requires a "sober mind" (<em>s┼ìphron</em>) to discern the will of God and the needs of the flock. Alcohol is a "mocker" (Proverbs 20:1) that displaces the Holy SpiritΓÇÖs control. A leader "beside wine" cannot be "beside the Word." Since an elder is a "steward of God" (v. 7), he must not be under the power of any substance that would lead him to "deny Him by his works" (v. 16). BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:7</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"...not quick-tempered, not <strong>given to wine</strong> (paroinos)..."</em> Paul is contrasting the elder with the "lazy gluttons" of Crete (v. 12). In a culture famous for excess, an elderΓÇÖs <strong>temperance</strong> was a revolutionary credential. If he was <em>paroinos</em>, he would naturally be "quick-tempered" and "violent," destroying the very order he was appointed to set (v. 5). <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a> </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 3:3:</strong> "...not <strong>given to wine</strong> (<em>paroinos</em>), not violent, not greedy for money..." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><em>Note: This specific adjective appears only twice in the NT (1 Tim 3:3 and Titus 1:7), specifically for church leaders.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ephesians 5:18:</strong> "And do not be drunk with <strong>wine</strong> (<em>oinos</em>)... but be filled with the Spirit."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 23:29-30 (LXX):</strong> "Who has woe?... Those who stay long at the <strong>wine</strong> (<em>oinos</em>)..." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
The <em>paroinos</em> man is the opposite of the <strong>"Self-Controlled"</strong> man (<em>enkrat─ôs</em>) in verse 8. One is led by the "cup," the other by the "Spirit." Paul demands a leader who is "drunk on the Truth," not one whose spiritual "vision" is blurred by fermented grapes. Precept Austin </p>
