<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Overturned Tables:</strong> This is the same word used in John 2:15 when Jesus "<strong>overturned</strong> the tables" of the moneychangers in the temple. The mental image is of a complete scattering of everything that was once orderly and in its place.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Capsize:</strong> In secular Greek writings, it was frequently used for a ship being capsized or a building being demolished. It suggests a disaster that leaves the original structure unusable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Household Upset:</strong> The word indicates a total disruption. If one member of a family is perverted by false teaching, the "whole house" is upset, like a table being flipped over, causing everything on it to fall and break. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Subversion is the direct opposite of "edification" (building up). It reveals that false doctrine is not a victimless crime; it is an active force of demolition. When the "unruly" teach for dishonest gain, they are not just sharing opinions—they are dismantling the very foundations of the faith in those they influence. </p>

<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:11</strong><br />
The NKJV states: "...who <strong>subvert</strong> (<em>anatrep┼ì</em>) whole households, teaching things which they ought not..." This highlights the gravity of the situation in Crete. The false teachers weren't just winning arguments; they were penetrating the fiber of families and house-churches to a degree that put the entire ministry at risk. Their "sneaky" and "greedy" motives necessitated an immediate muzzling. </p>

<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 2:18:</strong> "...who have strayed concerning the truth... and they <strong>overthrow</strong> (<em>anatrep┼ì</em>) the faith of some."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>John 2:15:</strong> "...He poured out the changersΓÇÖ money and <strong>overturned</strong> (<em>anatrep┼ì</em>) the tables."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acts 15:24:</strong> "...troubled you with words, <strong>unsettling</strong> (<em>anaskeuaz┼ì</em> - related concept) your souls..." (Note: A synonymous idea used in a similar context of false teaching). </p></li>

<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
The thoroughness of this destruction is marked by the word "<strong>whole</strong>" (<em>holous</em>) in the Greek text. These teachers didn't just affect individuals; they corrupted entire household units. This explains why Paul is so severe in his command to "stop their mouths"—you do not negotiate with a wrecking ball. </p>
