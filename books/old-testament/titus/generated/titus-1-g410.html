<p><strong>BLAMELESS</strong> — (<em>anegkl─ôtos</em>, StrongΓÇÖs G410)<br />
Refers to a person against whom no valid legal or moral charge can be sustained. In <strong>Titus 1:6</strong>, it does not mean "sinless perfection" but rather a "consistent integrity" such that no one can bring a justified accusation that would disqualify the leader or bring reproach upon the Gospel.

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A compound word from <em>a</em> (negative) + <em>en</em> (in) + <em>kale┼ì</em> (to call). It literally means "not called in"—as in, not called into a courtroom to face an indictment. Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Unreproachable, irreproachable, or "cannot be called to account." It describes a person whose life has been so thoroughly "straightened out" (v. 5) that there are no "handles" for an enemy to grab hold of to drag them into public disgrace. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Unindicted Citizen:</strong> In the Greek legal system, <em>anegkl─ôtos</em> was a technical term for a person who had <strong>no outstanding legal charges</strong> against them. They were "clear" in the eyes of the law.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Seamless Garment:</strong> A word picture often associated with this is a <strong>garment without a tear</strong>. While there may be small "threads" (minor faults), there is no massive "rip" (scandal) that ruins the entire piece. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Smooth Surface:</strong> It evokes the image of a <strong>polished shield</strong>; if someone tries to throw "mud" (accusations) at it, there is nothing for the mud to stick to, and it simply slides off. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Blamelessness is the "umbrella qualification" for elders. It does not imply that the man has never sinned, but that his <strong>repentance is as visible as his walk</strong>. He is a man of "one piece"—his private life and public profession match. If a leader is not <em>anegkl─ôtos</em>, he cannot "rebuke" others (v. 13) because his own life would contradict his message. BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:6</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"if a man is <strong>blameless</strong> (anegkl─ôtos), the husband of one wife..."</em> In the corrupt culture of Crete, where lying was the "national pastime," a "blameless" man would stand out like a lighthouse. Paul is setting a bar that excludes the "insubordinate" and "deceivers" (v. 10). To "set the church in order," the foundation stones (the elders) had to be "straight" and "un-cracked" by scandal. <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a> </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Corinthians 1:8:</strong> "...that you may be <strong>blameless</strong> (<em>anegkl─ôtos</em>) in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 3:10:</strong> "...then let them serve as deacons, being found <strong>blameless</strong> (<em>anegkl─ôtos</em>)."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Colossians 1:22:</strong> "...to present you holy, and <strong>blameless</strong> (<em>am┼ìmos</em>), and above reproach (<em>anegkl─ôtos</em>) in His sight." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a slight difference between <em>anegkl─ôtos</em> and <em>anepil─ômptos</em> (used in 1 Timothy 3:2). </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Anepil─ômptos:</strong> Means "cannot be seized"—an enemy cannot get a "grip" on the person.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anegkl─ôtos:</strong> Means "cannot be indicted"—no one can successfully bring the person to trial.<br />
Together, they demand a leader whose life is <strong>transparent and defensible</strong>. Precept Austin </p></li>
