<p><strong>FAITHFUL</strong> — (<em>pistos</em>, StrongΓÇÖs G4103)<br />
Refers to that which is utterly reliable, trustworthy, and certain. In <strong>Titus 1:9</strong>, it identifies the Word of God as an immovable foundation that never fails, never lies, and is worthy of the elderΓÇÖs total "holding fast" because its source is the God who cannot lie.

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>peith┼ì</em> (to persuade). In the passive sense, it describes that which has stood the test and has been proven worthy of "faith" (<em>pistis</em>). It is the "persuasive" Word because it is the "true" Word. Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Trustworthy, reliable, sure, or "true to one's word." It describes a message that is not only "believing" but "believable." In the Pastoral Epistles, it characterizes the Gospel as a solid deposit that can be leaned upon without fear of it breaking. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Verified Contract:</strong> In the ancient marketplace, <em>pistos</em> was used for a <strong>legal document that was verified</strong> as genuine. It was "faithful" because it was the "real thing," not a counterfeit. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Unshakable Pillar:</strong> A word picture associated with it is a <strong>foundation stone</strong> that does not shift during an earthquake. While the "Jewish fables" (v. 14) are like shifting sand, the <em>pistos</em> Word is a rock.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Reliable Guide:</strong> It evokes the image of a <strong>navigator's star</strong>. It is "faithful" because it is always in the same place; the traveler can stake their life on its position. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
The Word is "faithful" because the <strong>God who spoke it is faithful</strong> (v. 2). This is the objective ground for our "separation" to God. We are not "wholly His" based on a feeling, but based on a <em>pistos</em> Word. This faithfulness ensures that the Gospel will accomplish exactly what God promised it would—it will save, sanctify, and secure the "elect" (v. 1). BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:9</strong><br />
The <strong>NKJV</strong> says: <em>"...holding fast the <strong>faithful</strong> (pistos) word as he has been taught..."</em> Paul uses <em>pistos</em> twice in this chapter: first for the elder's children (v. 6) and here for the elder's Word. The "faithful" home is the proof of the "faithful" message. In a culture of "liars" (v. 12), the elder's only weapon is a message that is <strong>incapable of being false</strong>. <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a> </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 1:15:</strong> "This is a <strong>faithful</strong> (<em>pistos</em>) saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners..." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 2:13:</strong> "If we are faithless, He remains <strong>faithful</strong> (<em>pistos</em>); He cannot deny Himself."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Revelation 21:5:</strong> "...And He said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and <strong>faithful</strong> (<em>pistos</em>).'" </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
The <em>pistos</em> Word is what makes the elder <strong>"able"</strong> (the next word in the verse). His power to exhort and convict does not come from his personality, but from the "reliability" of the message he holds. Because the Word is <em>pistos</em>, it has the authority to "set in order" the crooked things of Crete. Precept Austin </p>
