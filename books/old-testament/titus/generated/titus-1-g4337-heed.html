<p><strong>HEED</strong> — (<em>prosechì</em>, StrongΓÇÖs G4337)<br />
Refers to a state of mental alertness where one "holds the mind" toward a specific object. It implies not just hearing, but becoming mentally occupied with or addicted to something, often to the point of being influenced by it. </p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>pros</em> (toward) + <em>echì</em> (to have or hold). It literally means "to hold toward." Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
To turn the mind to, to attend to, or to be attentive. It carries the sense of giving oneself over to something or bringing a ship to land. It describes a "focused gaze" of the intellect. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Nautical Approach:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>prosechì</em> was a <strong>nautical term</strong> used for "bringing a ship to port." The pilot "holds the mind" on the shore to ensure a safe docking. If you "heed" the wrong thing, you dock your life at the wrong port.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Guard Duty:</strong> It was used for <strong>sentries or guards</strong> who had to "pay attention" to the horizon. To fail to "heed" was to allow an enemy to slip through the gate unnoticed. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Addiction:</strong> In some contexts, it was used to describe someone who was <strong>addicted to wine</strong>. Their mind was "held" by the substance. Paul uses this same sense—the Cretans were "addicting" their minds to myths. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
What we "heed" determines our destination. Scripture commands us to "heed" the Word of God as a lamp (2 Peter 1:19), but warns that in the latter times, some will "heed" deceiving spirits (1 Timothy 4:1). To "heed" is to open the "eye of the soul" to an influence; it is never a neutral act. </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:14</strong><br />
Paul commands that they should not "give <strong>heed</strong> (<em>prosechì</em>) to Jewish myths." The false teachers were trying to get the Cretan believers to "dock their ships" in the port of legalism and fables. Paul warns that if they continue to "hold their minds" toward these myths, their faith will cease to be "sound" and will instead become "shipwrecked." </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 4:1:</strong> "...giving <strong>heed</strong> (<em>prosechì</em>) to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acts 8:6:</strong> "And the multitudes with one accord <strong>heeded</strong> (<em>prosechì</em>) the things spoken by Philip..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hebrews 2:1:</strong> "Therefore we must give the more earnest <strong>heed</strong> (<em>prosechì</em>) to the things we have heard, lest we drift away." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
The "sharp rebuke" of verse 13 is the only thing that can break the "trance" of a person who is "heeding" falsehood. <em>Prosechì</em> implies a level of fascination or curiosity. Paul tells Titus that these myths are not worth the believers' mental energy. To "heed" them is to waste the mind God intended for Truth. BibleRef </p>
