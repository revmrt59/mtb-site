<p><strong>CONSCIENCE</strong> — (<em>syneid─ôsis</em>, StrongΓÇÖs G4893)<br />
Refers to the internal moral compass that judges oneΓÇÖs own actions and thoughts. It is the "co-knowledge" within a person that acts as a witness, either accusing or excusing them based on the standards they have accepted as true. </p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>syn</em> (with/together) + <em>eid─ôsis</em> (knowledge). It literally means "joint-knowledge" or "knowing with oneself." Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
The soul as witnessing of its own conduct; the faculty of the soul which distinguishes between right and wrong. It is the internal judge that responds with a sense of peace when we follow our convictions and a sense of guilt when we violate them. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Internal Witness:</strong> In Greek drama and philosophy, <em>syneid─ôsis</em> was described as a <strong>witness in a courtroom</strong> who lives inside the defendant. Even if no one else saw the crime, the "joint-knowledge" within the person ensures they cannot truly escape the truth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Moral Compass:</strong> It functions like a <strong>magnetic compass</strong>. If the compass is "true," it guides the traveler home; if it is "defiled" or "seared," it gives false readings, leading the person into a spiritual wilderness. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Sun Dial:</strong> Philosophers compared it to a <strong>sun dial</strong>. The sun dial only works if it is exposed to the "light" (Truth). If it is placed in the shade (Deception), it is useless for telling time. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
The conscience is a God-given faculty, but it is not infallible. It can be "weak" (1 Cor 8:7), "seared with a hot iron" (1 Tim 4:2), or "defiled" (Titus 1:15). A healthy conscience is "purged" by the blood of Christ (Heb 9:14), allowing it to once again function as a reliable witness to God's standards. </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:15</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"even their mind and <strong>conscience</strong> (syneid─ôsis) are defiled."</em> Paul explains that the false teachers in Crete have a <strong>broken compass</strong>. Because their minds are "stained" by unbelief, their conscience no longer "screams" when they lie or exploit families. They can teach "Jewish fables" for "dishonest gain" without feeling the sting of guilt because their "internal witness" has been corrupted. </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Romans 2:15:</strong> "...their <strong>conscience</strong> (<em>syneid─ôsis</em>) also bearing witness, and between themselves their thoughts accusing or else excusing them."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 4:2:</strong> "...speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their own <strong>conscience</strong> (<em>syneid─ôsis</em>) seared with a hot iron."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hebrews 9:14:</strong> "...how much more shall the blood of Christ... cleanse your <strong>conscience</strong> (<em>syneid─ôsis</em>) from dead works...?" </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
The conscience and the <strong>mind</strong> (<em>nous</em>) work in tandem. The mind receives the "data" (the fables), and the conscience "judges" it. When both are defiled, the person becomes "unfit for every good work" (v. 16). They have lost the ability to even <em>feel</em> that they are in rebellion against God. <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-15.html"><u>BibleRef</u></a> </p>
