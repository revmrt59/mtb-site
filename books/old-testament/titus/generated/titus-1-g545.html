<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>a-</em> (negative) + <em>peith┼ì</em> (to persuade). It literally means "one who refuses to be persuaded." Bible Hub </p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Unbelieving, disobedient, or contumacious. In the New Testament, it goes beyond simple failure to obey; it implies a <strong>settled state of mind</strong> that has decided to reject GodΓÇÖs Word regardless of the evidence presented. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon </p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Obstinate Debater:</strong> In Greek philosophy and law, <em>apeith─ôs</em> described someone who, after hearing a clear and logical argument, <strong>refused to concede</strong>. It was the mark of a closed mind that prioritized personal opinion over proven fact.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Unruly Child:</strong> It was commonly used to describe a <strong>rebellious child</strong> who hears their parentΓÇÖs instruction but chooses to "shut their ears" and do the opposite. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Muted Compass:</strong> A word picture is that of a <strong>navigator who ignores the stars</strong>. Even when the light of truth (the stars) is clearly visible, the <em>apeith─ôs</em> person insists on steering the ship according to their own "fables" and "myths." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Biblical "faith" (<em>pistis</em>) is rooted in being "persuaded" (<em>peith┼ì</em>) by God. Therefore, <em>apeith─ôs</em> is the <strong>opposite of faith</strong>. It is the spiritual condition of those who see the "light of the knowledge of the glory of God" but choose to "turn from the truth" (v. 14). Because they are "un-persuadable" by the Gospel, they are left with nothing but their own "commandments of men." </p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:16</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"being abominable, <strong>disobedient</strong> (apeith─ôs), and disqualified..."</em> This is PaulΓÇÖs second verdict. The false teachers were not just "uninformed"; they were <strong>willfully defiant</strong>. Despite their "profession" to know God, they were "un-persuaded" by His character and His laws. Their disobedience was the natural fruit of a heart that refused to submit to the "sound doctrine" of Titus 1:9. BibleRef </p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Luke 1:17:</strong> "...to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the <strong>disobedient</strong> (<em>apeith─ôs</em>) to the wisdom of the just..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Romans 1:30:</strong> "...inventors of evil things, <strong>disobedient</strong> (<em>apeith─ôs</em>) to parents..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 3:2:</strong> "...proud, blasphemers, <strong>disobedient</strong> (<em>apeith─ôs</em>) to parents, unthankful, unholy..." </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a progression in Titus 1:16. Because they were "abominable" (foul in nature), they became "disobedient" (rebellious in action). When a person is <em>apeith─ôs</em>, they are beyond the reach of gentle correction; they require the "sharp rebuke" (v. 13) to crack the shell of their "un-persuadable" heart. Bible Hub </p>
