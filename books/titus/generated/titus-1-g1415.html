<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>dynamai</em> (to be able/to have power). It is the root of the English word "dynamic" or "dynamite." It signifies having the necessary "force" to achieve a result. Bible Hub┬á</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Powerful, mighty, or capable. It describes one who has the capacity, whether through natural talent or divine endowment, to excel in a particular task. In the New Testament, it often refers to being "mighty in word and deed." ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon┬á</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Competent Soldier:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>dynatos</em> described a <strong>soldier who was fit for battle</strong>. He didn't just have the rank; he had the "muscle" and the skill to actually defeat the enemy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Weight-Lifter:</strong> A word picture associated with it is a <strong>man who can lift a heavy load</strong>. While others buckle under the weight of "lacking" things (v. 5) or false teachers (v. 10), the <em>dynatos</em> leader has the strength to carry the burden. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Full Battery:</strong> It evokes the image of a <strong>source of power</strong> that is "charged up." The elder is "able" because he is connected to the "power-grid" of the <em>pistos</em> Word.┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
God is the "Mighty One" (<em>Ho Dynatos</em>). Human ability is always a derivative of God's power. Paul is clear that our "sufficiency is from God" (2 Cor 3:5). An elder is "able" not because of his IQ or personality, but because he is <strong>clothed with the power of the Word</strong>. It is a "functional holiness"ΓÇöhis separation to God (<em>hagios</em>) results in him being "empowered" by God (<em>dynatos</em>) for the work of the ministry. BibleRef┬á</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:9</strong><br />
The <strong>NKJV</strong> says: <em>"...that he may be <strong>able</strong> (dynatos), by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convict..."</em> This is the "so what?" of the qualifications. A man can be "blameless" and "hospitable," but if he is not <strong>able</strong> to handle the Word, he cannot be an elder. In Crete, the elders had to be "spiritual heavyweights" to knock down the "meaningless talk" (v. 10) of the deceivers. <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a>┬á</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Romans 4:21:</strong> "...fully convinced that what He had promised He was also <strong>able</strong> (<em>dynatos</em>) to do." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Luke 24:19:</strong> "...Jesus of Nazareth, who was a Prophet <strong>mighty</strong> (<em>dynatos</em>) in deed and word before God..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acts 18:24:</strong> "...Apollos... an eloquent man and <strong>mighty</strong> (<em>dynatos</em>) in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus."┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a specific sequence here: <strong>Holding Fast</strong> (tenacity) leads to being <strong>Able</strong> (competency). You cannot be "able" to defend the truth if you are not "holding fast" to it. The elder's "ability" is surgically precise; he uses "sound doctrine" to "exhort" (build up) and "convict" (shut down).
