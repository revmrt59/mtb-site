<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>en</em> (in) + <em>kratos</em> (power/strength). It literally means "one who has power within" or "in-strength." It describes the internal strength to hold one's desires in check. Bible Hub┬á</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Master of oneself; continent, or temperate. It signifies the ability to restrain one's own impulses and emotions. While <em>s┼ìphr┼ìn</em> (sober-minded) refers to the <strong>mental clarity</strong>, <em>enkrat─ôs</em> refers to the <strong>active power</strong> to say "no" to the flesh.

<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Disciplined Athlete:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>enkrat─ôs</em> was a technical term for <strong>athletes in training</strong>. They were "self-controlled" in their diet, sleep, and exercise to ensure they were fit for the competition. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Fortress Commander:</strong> A word picture associated with it is a <strong>commander who holds a city</strong>. He has "power within" the walls; he decides who enters and who is barred, ensuring the "fortress" of the soul is not overrun by invading lusts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Taming of a Beast:</strong> It evokes the image of a <strong>rider who has total control over a powerful stallion</strong>. The energy is there, but it is "bridled" and directed by a superior will.┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Self-control is a "fruit of the Spirit" (Galatians 5:23). It is the supernatural ability to live a "separated" (<em>hagios</em>) life by refusing to let the "belly" (appetite) become a god. Since the elder must guard the church from "beastly" influencers, he must first prove that he has "mastery" over his own beastly nature. It is the victory of the Spirit over the "me-first" nature of the flesh. BibleRef┬á</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:8</strong><br />
The <strong>NKJV</strong> says: <em>"...holy, <strong>self-controlled</strong> (enkrat─ôs)..."</em> This is the "closing argument" for the elder's character. It stands in direct opposition to the "lazy gluttons" of Crete (v. 12) who were <em>akrat─ôs</em> (without control). By being <em>enkrat─ôs</em>, the elder demonstrates that the Gospel provides the <strong>internal power</strong> to live a life that is distinct from the chaotic culture around him. <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a>┬á</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Corinthians 9:25:</strong> "And everyone who competes for the prize is <strong>temperate</strong> (<em>enkrateuomai</em>ΓÇöverb form) in all things." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Peter 1:6:</strong> "...to knowledge <strong>self-control</strong> (<em>enkrateia</em>ΓÇönoun form), to self-control perseverance..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Galatians 5:23:</strong> "...gentleness, <strong>self-control</strong> (<em>enkrateia</em>). Against such there is no law."┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
In Titus 1, the elder is a "steward" who must not be "given to wine" or "greedy" (v. 7). These are all battles of <strong>appetite</strong>. <em>Enkrat─ôs</em> is the virtue that "wins" those battles. It is the outward proof of an inward "separation" to God; a man who is "wholly His" will not allow his "self" to run wild. Precept Austin┬á</p>
