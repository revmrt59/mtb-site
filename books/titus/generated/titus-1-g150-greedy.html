<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A compound word from <em>aischros</em> (shameful, deformed, or base) and <em>kerdos</em> (gain or profit). It literally means "shameful-gain-seeker." Bible Hub┬á</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Eager for base gain; sordidly greedy. It refers to someone who is preoccupied with personal profit to the point that they would obtain it through unseemly or dishonest methods. In the New Testament, it is the opposite of being a generous "steward of God." ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon┬á</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Weighted Scale:</strong> In the Greek marketplace, this word described a merchant who used <strong>deceptive weights</strong> to cheat customers. The profit was "shameful" because it was stolen under the guise of trade. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Religious Con-Artist:</strong> It was used for <strong>itinerant priests or philosophers</strong> who performed rituals solely to extract money from the superstitious. They were "greedy" for the coins, not the truth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Deformed Reward:</strong> The root <em>aischros</em> refers to something <strong>physically ugly or deformed</strong>. The word picture is of a man clutching gold that is covered in filthΓÇöthe money itself has become "ugly" because of the "shameful" way it was earned.┬á</p></li>

<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
"No one can serve two masters" (Matthew 6:24). If a leader is <em>aischrokerd─ôs</em>, his "god" is his belly (Philippians 3:19). A steward must manage the MasterΓÇÖs resources for the MasterΓÇÖs glory; a greedy man manages them for his own pocket. This vice is the hallmark of a false teacher, who views "godliness as a means of gain" (1 Timothy 6:5). <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a>┬á</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:7</strong><br />
The <strong>NKJV</strong> says: <em>"...not violent, not <strong>greedy</strong> (aischrokerd─ôs) for money..."</em> Paul is contrasting the elder with the false teachers in verse 11 who were "teaching things they ought not, for the sake of <strong>dishonest gain</strong>." In Crete, where "dishonesty" was a cultural trait, a leaderΓÇÖs <strong>financial integrity</strong> was his most powerful testimony. If he was greedy, he could be "bought" by the very people he was supposed to rebuke. BibleRef┬á</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 3:3:</strong> "...not violent, not <strong>greedy</strong> (<em>aischrokerd─ôs</em>) for money, but gentle..." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Peter 5:2:</strong> "Shepherd the flock of God... not for <strong>dishonest gain</strong> (<em>aischrokerd─ôs</em>) but eagerly."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 3:8:</strong> "...not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not <strong>greedy</strong> (<em>aischrokerd─ôs</em>) for money..."┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
Greed is a form of idolatry (Colossians 3:5). The <em>aischrokerd─ôs</em> man is the opposite of the <strong>"Hospitable"</strong> man in verse 8. Hospitality requires <em>spending</em> one's resources for others; greed requires <em>hoarding</em> resources for oneself. A greedy man cannot "open his home" because he is too afraid of what it will cost him. Precept Austin┬á</p>
