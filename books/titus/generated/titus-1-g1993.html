Derived from <em>epi-</em> (upon) and <em>stoma</em> (mouth). It literally means to "put something upon the mouth." <a href="https://www.bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Lexicon.show/ID/G1993/epistomizo.htm"><u>Bible Tools</u></a></p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
To stop the mouth, to muzzle, or to reduce to silence. In a figurative sense, it means to use irresistible logic or authority to make it impossible for someone to continue their argument. <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/kjv/epistomizo.html"><u>Bible Study Tools</u></a></p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Bridle:</strong> In secular literature, this word was commonly used for <strong>bridling a horse</strong>. It described the physical bit placed in a horse's mouth to bring a powerful, headstrong animal under control. <a href="https://versebyversecommentary.com/2015/01/20/titus-111/"><u>Verse by Verse Commentary</u></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Muzzle:</strong> It was also used for <strong>muzzling a dangerous animal</strong> to prevent it from biting. This provides a vivid "Word Picture" of the false teachers in CreteΓÇöPaul viewed their speech as a <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-11.html"><u>predatory threat</u></a> that needed a "muzzle."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Stopper:</strong> It could refer to putting a "plug" or "stopper" in a vessel to prevent it from leaking or pouring out. Blue Letter Bible</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Silencing in the New Testament is an act of <strong>stewardship and protection</strong>. It echoes JesusΓÇÖ description of the Good Shepherd who protects the flock from wolves. Truth and love are not opposed here; stopping a false mouth is an act of love for the vulnerable families being "upset." <a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/1993.htm"><u>Bible Hub</u></a></p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:11</strong><br />
Paul uses the imperative "must." This is a <strong>command</strong>, not a suggestion. Because the Cretan culture was notorious for being "always liars," Titus could not be passive. The false teachers' mouths had to be "bridled" with sound doctrine so they could no longer "steer" the church into error.</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Note: This specific word occurs only once in the NT (Titus 1:11), but its synonym <strong>phi-mo-┼ì</strong> (also meaning to muzzle) is used elsewhere:</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Matthew 22:34:</strong> "...when the Pharisees heard that He had <strong>silenced</strong> (<em>phi-mo-┼ì</em>) the Sadducees..." (Jesus used truth to make them speechless).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Peter 2:15:</strong> "...by doing good you may <strong>put to silence</strong> (<em>phi-mo-┼ì</em>) the ignorance of foolish men."</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
To "silence" these teachers, Titus had to be better equipped with the Word than they were. You cannot muzzle a lie with an opinion; you can only muzzle a lie with the <strong>Truth</strong>.</p>
