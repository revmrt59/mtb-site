<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
From a primary (but obsolete) root <em>erg┼ì</em> (to work). It signifies any deed or action, whether good or bad, that a person performs. Bible Hub┬á</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
A deed, action, or anything accomplished by hand or art. It refers to the "fruit" of one's labor and the visible manifestation of one's character and hidden thoughts. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon┬á</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Finished Product:</strong> In the Greek marketplace, <em>ergon</em> was used for a <strong>finished piece of craftsmanship</strong>ΓÇöa pot, a statue, or a woven garment. It wasn't the "idea" of the pot, but the pot itself.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Agricultural Yield:</strong> It described the <strong>work of the field</strong> and the resulting harvest. To have no "work" meant there was no grain in the barn. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Evidence in Court:</strong> In legal settings, it was used for <strong>evidence of an act</strong>. Words could be debated, but an <em>ergon</em> (a deed done) was considered an undeniable fact.┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
While we are not saved <em>by</em> works (Ephesians 2:8-9), we are saved <em>for</em> works. <em>Ergon</em> is the "life-testimony" of the believer. God "will render to each one according to his <strong>deeds</strong> (<em>ergon</em>)" (Romans 2:6). Faith without <em>ergon</em> is dead (James 2:20) because it lacks the "evidence" of life.┬á</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:16</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"but in <strong>works</strong> (ergon) they deny Him... disqualified for every good <strong>work</strong> (ergon)."</em> Paul uses this word twice to hammer home his point: <strong>Your actions are your true language.</strong> The false teachers spoke "God-talk," but their "deeds" (greed, fables, insubordination) were shouting a denial of Christ. Because their nature was "abominable," they were "unfit" to produce any "finished product" that God could approve. BibleRef┬á</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Matthew 5:16:</strong> "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good <strong>works</strong> (<em>ergon</em>) and glorify your Father..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>James 2:17:</strong> "Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have <strong>works</strong> (<em>ergon</em>), is dead."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>John 14:12:</strong> "...and greater <strong>works</strong> (<em>ergon</em>) than these he will do, because I go to My Father."┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
In Titus 1, "works" act as the <strong>spiritual DNA</strong>. Just as a thorn bush cannot produce grapes, a "defiled" mind cannot produce a "good work." The tragedy of the false teachers was that they were busy doing "religious things," but in God's eyes, they were doing no "good work" at all. Bible Hub┬á</p>
