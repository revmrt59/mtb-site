<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Purity in the New Testament is primarily an <strong>internal reality</strong> rather than an external ritual. While the "circumcision group" (v. 10) focused on "pure foods" and "pure rituals," Paul argues that true purity is a result of the Gospel "purifying the heart by faith" (Acts 15:9). A "pure" person is someone whose motives and mind have been aligned with GodΓÇÖs truth.┬á</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:15</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"To the <strong>pure</strong> (katharos) all things are pure."</em> This is a direct strike against the "commandments of men" (v. 14). Paul is teaching that for the believer whose conscience is clean through Christ, external things like food or Jewish rituals cannot "defile" them. The <strong>purity of the heart</strong> acts as a filter that sees and uses GodΓÇÖs creation for His glory. <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-15.html"><u>BibleRef</u></a>┬á</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Matthew 5:8:</strong> "Blessed are the <strong>pure</strong> (<em>katharos</em>) in heart, for they shall see God."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 1:5:</strong> "Now the purpose of the commandment is love from a <strong>pure</strong> (<em>katharos</em>) heart..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>James 1:27:</strong> "<strong>Pure</strong> (<em>katharos</em>) and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this..."┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a profound contrast between the "pure" and the "defiled." If the "lens" of the heart is <em>katharos</em>, everything it looks at is seen through the light of GodΓÇÖs goodness. However, if the "lens" is dirty (defiled), even holy things are twisted into something sinful. Purity is the <strong>spiritual health</strong> that allows the believer to enjoy God's world without being enslaved by it.┬á</p>
