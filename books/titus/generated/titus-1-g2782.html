<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>k─ôryss┼ì</em> (to herald or proclaim). It stems from the root <em>k─ôryx</em>, which refers to a "herald" or an official town crier. Bible Hub┬á</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
That which is proclaimed by a herald or crier. While it can refer to the "act" of preaching, in the Pastoral Epistles, it primarily denotes the <strong>substance</strong> of the messageΓÇöthe "Kerygma"ΓÇöthe core facts of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Royal Herald:</strong> In the ancient world, a <em>k─ôryx</em> was an official whose person was sacred. He traveled into a town to announce a <strong>royal decree or a declaration of war/peace</strong>. He did not share his own opinions; he simply "shouted" the King's words exactly as they were given.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Olympic Crier:</strong> It was used for the official who announced the <strong>names of the winners</strong> at the Olympic games. The announcement was an objective fact that brought honor to the recipient. <a href="https://www.preceptaustin.org/titus_11-9"><u>Precept Austin</u></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The "Town Crier's" Bell:</strong> A word picture associated with <em>k─ôrygma</em> is the <strong>clarion call</strong>. It is a sound intended to cut through the noise of the marketplace to demand the attention of every citizen.┬á</p></li>

<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
God has chosen "preaching" as the delivery system for His grace. It is not "logic" or "philosophy" that saves, but the <strong>proclamation</strong> of what God has already done. The power of <em>k─ôrygma</em> lies in the authority of the One who sent the message, not the eloquence of the messenger. It is the "manifestation" (the making visible) of GodΓÇÖs hidden eternal plan (v. 2). <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a>┬á</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:3</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"...but has in due time manifested His word through <strong>preaching</strong> (k─ôrygma)..."</em> Paul is showing the timeline: 1. God <strong>promised</strong> (v. 2), 2. God <strong>manifested</strong> (v. 3), and 3. God <strong>committed</strong> it to Paul. The eternal promise of verse 2 stayed "hidden" until it was "shouted" through the <em>kerygma</em>. For the Cretans, the only way to access the "hope of eternal life" was to listen to this authorized proclamation. BibleRef┬á</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Corinthians 1:21:</strong> "...it pleased God through the foolishness of the <strong>message preached</strong> (<em>k─ôrygma</em>) to save those who believe." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 4:17:</strong> "...that through me the <strong>preaching</strong> (<em>k─ôrygma</em>) might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Romans 16:25:</strong> "...according to my gospel and the <strong>preaching</strong> (<em>k─ôrygma</em>) of Jesus Christ..."┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a profound weight in the fact that this was <strong>"committed"</strong> to Paul. He didn't invent the message; he was "entrusted" with it as a sacred deposit. In a culture of "liars," the "herald" had to be absolutely faithful to the King's script. If the herald changes the message, he ceases to be an <em>apostolos</em> and becomes a "deceiver" (v. 10).
