<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>ana-</em> (up, or again) + <em>trep┼ì</em> (to turn). It literally means "to turn upside down" or "to overturn." Bible Hub┬á</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
To subvert, to overthrow, or to render useless. In the New Testament, it is used metaphorically to describe the effect of error on a believer's lifeΓÇöit doesn't just "bother" them; it <strong>collapses</strong> their spiritual structure. Thayer's Greek Lexicon┬á</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Overturned Table:</strong> In secular Greek, this word was used for <strong>knocking over a table</strong> or a chair. It is the same word used in the Gospels when Jesus "overturned" the tables of the money changers. It implies a sudden, violent disruption of order.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Demolished Building:</strong> Architects used <em>anatrep┼ì</em> for the <strong>demolition of a wall</strong> or the undermining of a foundation. The building might still look standing for a moment, but its structural integrity has been destroyed from beneath. <a href="https://www.preceptaustin.org/titus_110-16"><u>Precept Austin</u></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Capsized Ship:</strong> It was also used in nautical contexts for a <strong>ship being turned over</strong> by a wave. Once capsized, the vessel is "unfit" for its purpose and everyone on board is in peril.┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Faith is often described in Scripture as a "building" or a "walk." False teaching is not just "different information"; it is a <strong>demolition crew</strong>. When the "circumcision group" taught that grace was not enough, they were "overturning" the very foundation (Christ) upon which the believers' hope was built. If the foundation is turned over, the entire Christian life collapses into legalism or despair.┬á</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:11</strong><br />
Paul notes that they are upsetting <strong>"whole households."</strong> In the early church, the "household" (<em>oikos</em>) was the primary unit of the church. By infiltrating a home, these teachers were destroying the faith of the father, mother, children, and servants all at once. It shows that false doctrine is highly contagious and socially destructive.┬á</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 2:18:</strong> "...who have strayed concerning the truth... and they <strong>overthrow</strong> (<em>anatrep┼ì</em>) the faith of some."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>John 2:15:</strong> "...He poured out the changersΓÇÖ money and <strong>overturned</strong> (<em>anatrep┼ì</em>) the tables."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acts 15:24:</strong> "...some who went out from us have troubled you with words, <strong>subverting</strong> (<em>anaskeuaz┼ì</em>ΓÇöa related synonym) your souls..."┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
The "upsetting" was done "for the sake of dishonest gain." This reveals a predatory nature: the teachers didn't care that they were destroying families' spiritual lives as long as they were getting paid. They were willing to "burn down the house" to scavenge the gold in the ashes. <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-11.html"><u>BibleRef</u></a>┬á</p>
