<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A compound word from <em>peri</em> (around) and <em>temn┼ì</em> (to cut). It literally means "a cutting around."┬á</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
The act of circumcision. In the New Testament, it is frequently used as a <strong>metonymy</strong> (a figure of speech) to represent the Jewish people or, more specifically, the "Party of the Circumcision"ΓÇöthose who strictly adhered to the Mosaic Law as a means of justification. Thayer's Greek Lexicon┬á</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Identity Mark:</strong> In the Greco-Roman world, circumcision was a <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-10.html"><u>highly visible and culturally distinct</u></a> practice. Greeks valued the "integrity" of the physical body; therefore, this "cutting" was often viewed with derision. For the Jew, however, it was the "seal" of the covenant.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Boundary Stone:</strong> It functioned as a <strong>social wall</strong>. It was the "Word Picture" of exclusionΓÇöif you didn't have the mark, you were "outside" the family of God.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Spiritual Shadow:</strong> The physical act was always meant to be a picture of the <strong>"circumcision of the heart"</strong> (Deut 30:6)ΓÇöthe cutting away of the stubborn will. PaulΓÇÖs opponents kept the "shadow" (the physical cut) but lost the "substance" (the heart change). <a href="https://www.preceptaustin.org/titus_110-16"><u>Precept Austin</u></a>┬á</p></li>

<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
The "Circumcision Group" represents the primary theological enemy of the Gospel of Grace: <strong>Legalism</strong>. By demanding circumcision for Gentiles, they were essentially saying that ChristΓÇÖs death was "not enough"ΓÇöthat one must add human effort and physical ritual to be truly saved. Paul views this not as "extra-holy," but as a rejection of the Cross.┬á</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:10</strong><br />
Paul identifies this group as the <em>source</em> of the "meaningless talk" and "deception." Because they were religious insiders who knew the Scriptures, they were the most dangerous. They used their "Jewishness" as a badge of authority to bully the Cretan believers into a system of rules that bypassed the power of the Holy Spirit.┬á</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Philippians 3:3:</strong> "For we are the <strong>circumcision</strong> (<em>peritom─ô</em>), who worship God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Galatians 5:2:</strong> "Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become <strong>circumcised</strong> (<em>peritemn┼ì</em>), Christ will profit you nothing."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Colossians 2:11:</strong> "In Him you were also <strong>circumcised</strong> (<em>peritemn┼ì</em>) with the circumcision made without hands..."┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
PaulΓÇÖs critique is ironic. The "circumcision group" boasted of being "cut," but Paul implies their hearts were still "thick" and "uncircumcised." They were obsessed with a small piece of flesh while their entire souls were "insubordinate" to the Gospel. Bible Hub┬á</p>
