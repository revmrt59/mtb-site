<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Street Fighter:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>pl─ôkt─ôs</em> described a <strong>combative man</strong> who was quick to start a physical altercation. It evokes the image of a "brawler" who uses his strength to intimidate others. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Lashing Tongue:</strong> A word picture associated with it is a <strong>whip or a lash</strong>. Just as a whip leaves a physical welt, a <em>pl─ôkt─ôs</em> leader leaves emotional and spiritual welts on people through harsh, "hitting" words.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Out-of-Control Hammer:</strong> It describes a tool that is <strong>smashing everything in its path</strong> rather than building anything up. Instead of "setting in order" (v. 5), the striker "breaks down."┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
The "servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all" (2 Timothy 2:24). A <em>pl─ôkt─ôs</em> leader fails to reflect the character of Christ, who "when He was reviled, did not revile in return" (1 Peter 2:23). Since an elder is a "steward of God" (v. 7), he must lead by <strong>spiritual influence</strong>, not by "striking" fear or using physical/emotional force. BibleRef┬á</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:7</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"...not given to wine, not <strong>violent</strong> (pl─ôkt─ôs)..."</em> (Note: Some NKJV editions translate this as "not a <strong>striker</strong>"). Paul links this directly to being "given to wine" because alcohol often releases this violent impulse. In the "beastly" culture of Crete (v. 12), violence was a sign of "strength." Paul redefines strength as <strong>self-restraint</strong>. A violent man can never "set in order" a church because he creates chaos wherever he goes. <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a>┬á</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 3:3:</strong> "...not given to wine, not <strong>violent</strong> (<em>pl─ôkt─ôs</em>), not greedy for money..." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><em>Note: This specific word appears only twice in the NT (1 Tim 3:3 and Titus 1:7), both times as a disqualification for church leadership.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Matthew 26:51:</strong> "...drew his sword and <strong>struck</strong> (<em>patass┼ì</em>ΓÇöa related root) the servant of the high priest..." (The physical action Paul forbids).┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
The <em>pl─ôkt─ôs</em> is the opposite of the <strong>"Self-Controlled"</strong> man in verse 8. The striker is controlled by his "beastly" instincts (v. 12), while the godly elder is controlled by the Spirit. A "striker" may win an argument through force, but he loses the soul of the person he is trying to lead. Precept Austin┬á</p>
