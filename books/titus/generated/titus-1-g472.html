<p><strong>HOLDING FAST</strong> ΓÇö (<em>antechomai</em>, StrongΓÇÖs G472)<br />
Refers to a tenacious, unyielding grip on something of great value. In <strong>Titus 1:9</strong>, it identifies the elder as a man who is "glued" to the Word of God, refusing to let go of sound doctrine even when faced with the "wind and waves" of false teaching and cultural pressure.

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A compound verb from <em>anti</em> (against/opposite) + <em>ech┼ì</em> (to have or hold). It literally means "to hold oneself against" something, implying a "counter-pressure" to keep an object from being pulled away. Bible Hub┬á</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
To hold firmly, to cleave to, or to be devoted to. It describes a persistent adherence to a person or thing. In the New Testament, it signifies a loyal devotion that refuses to be "shaken loose" by opposing forces. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon┬á</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Shipwreck Survivor:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>antechomai</em> was used for a <strong>drowning man holding fast to a piece of wreckage</strong>. His life depends on his grip; if he lets go, he sinks. The elder "holds fast" to the Word as his only hope of survival. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Magnetic Attraction:</strong> It was used for two things that are <strong>bound or glued together</strong> so tightly they act as one. The elder is so "attached" to the Word that his thoughts and the WordΓÇÖs truth move in perfect sync.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Tug-of-War:</strong> A word picture associated with it is a <strong>man pulling against a rope</strong>. As false teachers (v. 10) try to "pull" the church away, the elder "holds fast" in the opposite direction, providing the necessary counter-tension to keep the church stable.┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Truth is not a "hobby" for the elder; it is his <strong>foundation</strong>. To <em>antechomai</em> the Word means to be fully "convinced" of its authority. This tenacious grip is required because "the faith" is under constant attack. If a leader has a "loose grip" on doctrine, he will be "carried away with every wind of doctrine" (Eph 4:14). Stability in the pulpit depends on the elderΓÇÖs "un-persuadable" devotion to the Truth. BibleRef┬á</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:9</strong><br />
The <strong>NKJV</strong> says: <em>"<strong>holding fast</strong> (antechomai) the faithful word as he has been taught..."</em> This is the "intellectual muscle" of the elder. He doesn't just "know" the Word; he <strong>clings</strong> to it. In Crete, where people "turned from the truth" (v. 14), the elder had to be the "anchor-man" who refused to budge. This grip is what enables him to perform the dual task of the next phrases: encouraging the church and refuting the liars. <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a>┬á</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Matthew 6:24:</strong> "...he will be devoted to (<em>antechomai</em>) the one and despise the other." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Thessalonians 5:14:</strong> "...comfort the fainthearted, <strong>uphold</strong> (<em>antechomai</em>) the weak, be patient with all."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Luke 16:13:</strong> "...he will be <strong>loyal to</strong> (<em>antechomai</em>) the one and despise the other."┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a direct connection between the <strong>Self-Control</strong> (<em>enkrat─ôs</em>) of verse 8 and the <strong>Holding Fast</strong> of verse 9. A man who cannot control his own appetites will eventually "let go" of the Word to justify his sin. The elder "holds fast" to the Word because the Word "holds fast" to him, providing the "separation" to God that you rightly identified. Precept Austin┬á</p>
