<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>apotemn┼ì</em>, which comes from <em>apo-</em> (off/away) + <em>temn┼ì</em> (to cut). It literally means "in a manner that cuts off." Bible Hub┬á</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Abruptly, curtly, or severely. It characterizes a speech or action that is "precisely cutting." It implies a lack of "softness" in the approach, necessitated by the gravity of the situation. Thayer's Greek Lexicon┬á</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Steep Cliff:</strong> In classical Greek, the adjective form (<em>apotomos</em>) described a <strong>sheer precipice or a jagged cliff</strong>. The word picture is of a vertical dropΓÇöthere is no "slope" or "middle ground"; you are either on the path or you have fallen off.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The SurgeonΓÇÖs Knife:</strong> It was used for <strong>amputation</strong> or the swift cutting away of diseased flesh. The goal was not to cause pain but to save the rest of the body by "sharply" removing the rot before it spread. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The CarpenterΓÇÖs Tool:</strong> It was used to describe a tool that made a <strong>clean, decisive cut</strong> through wood, as opposed to a blunt tool that would splinter the material.┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
While the Gospel is a message of gentleness, there are moments where <strong>severity</strong> is the only merciful option. <em>Apotom┼ìs</em> is the verbal equivalent of a "tough love" intervention. If a person is sleepwalking toward a cliff, a gentle whisper is insufficient; a "sharp" shout is required. This severity is directed at the sin and the false teaching to protect the "flock" from spiritual infection.┬á</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:13</strong><br />
Paul commands Titus to "rebuke them <strong>sharply</strong>." Given that the Cretans were "liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons" (v. 12), a mild correction would be swallowed up by their carnal nature. Titus had to use a "sharp" rebuke to pierce through their calloused consciences. The goal, however, was not destruction, but <strong>restoration</strong>ΓÇö"that they may be sound in the faith."┬á</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>2 Corinthians 13:10:</strong> "Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use <strong>sharpness</strong> (<em>apotom┼ìs</em>), according to the power which the Lord has given me..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Romans 11:22:</strong> "Therefore consider the goodness and <strong>severity</strong> (<em>apotomia</em>ΓÇöthe noun form) of God..." (Contrasting God's kindness with His "sharp" judgment of unbelief).┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
The "sharpness" of the rebuke is found in the <strong>Word of God</strong>, which is "sharper than any two-edged sword" (Hebrews 4:12). Titus wasn't being told to be mean-spirited or "sharp-tongued" in a worldly sense, but to let the <strong>decisive edge of Truth</strong> do the cutting. BibleRef┬á</p>
