<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A primary verb (<em>arneomai</em>) signifying to say "no," to refuse, or to renounce. It is the direct opposite of <em>homologe┼ì</em> (to confess/agree). Bible Hub┬á</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
To deny, disown, or abjure. It means to act in a way that is inconsistent with a previous claim or relationship. In the New Testament, it often refers to a refusal to recognize the claims of Christ or a betrayal of one's stated allegiance. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon┬á</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Disowned Child:</strong> In Roman and Greek law, it was used for <strong>disinheriting a family member</strong>. To "deny" a son meant to legally declare he no longer belonged to the household. The false teachersΓÇÖ works "legally" declared they did not belong to God.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Contract Breaker:</strong> It was used for <strong>repudiating a treaty or a debt</strong>. One party simply "denied" that the agreement existed. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Silent Contradiction:</strong> A word picture is that of a <strong>witness who remains silent</strong> or points in the opposite direction when asked for the truth. While the mouth says "I know Him," the hands and feet "deny" Him by moving toward sin.┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Denial is not always verbal. While Peter denied Jesus with his tongue, the false teachers in Titus denied Him with their <strong>behavior</strong>. Scriptural "knowing" of God implies intimacy and obedience; therefore, to live in "insubordinate" (v. 10) rebellion is to "deny" the very nature of the God one claims to serve.┬á</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:16</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"They profess to know God, but in works they <strong>deny</strong> (arneomai) Him."</em> Paul is pointing out a "double-life." Their "works" (their "beastly" behavior, greed, and fables) were the real testimony. By their actions, they were telling the world that God is not holy, not authoritative, and not enough. Their lifestyle was a constant <strong>renunciation</strong> of the Gospel. BibleRef┬á</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Matthew 10:33:</strong> "But whoever <strong>denies</strong> (<em>arneomai</em>) Me before men, him I will also deny before My Father..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 2:12:</strong> "...If we <strong>deny</strong> (<em>arneomai</em>) Him, He also will deny us."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 Timothy 5:8:</strong> "But if anyone does not provide for his own... he has <strong>denied</strong> (<em>arneomai</em>) the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a "sharp" irony here: these legalists were obsessed with "commandments" (v. 14) and rituals to <em>prove</em> they knew God, yet Paul says those very works were the evidence of their <strong>rejection</strong> of Him. They were using religion to "deny" the Relationship. Bible Hub┬á</p>
