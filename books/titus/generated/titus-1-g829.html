<p><strong>SELF-WILLLED</strong> ΓÇö (<em>authad─ôs</em>, StrongΓÇÖs G829)<br />
Refers to a person who is stubbornly dominated by their own interests, opinions, and desires.

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A compound word from <em>autos</em> (self) + <em>h─ôdomai</em> (to please or be gratified). It literally means "self-pleasing." It describes someone who determines their own path without regard for others. Bible Hub┬á</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Self-willed, headstrong, or obstinate. It signifies an arrogant person who, in their overweening self-confidence, maintains their own opinion and asserts their own rights while being insensitive to the feelings or needs of others. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon┬á</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Tyrannical Ruler:</strong> In secular Greek, <em>authad─ôs</em> was used for <strong>despots and tyrants</strong> who governed by whim rather than law. They "pleased themselves" at the expense of the people. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Unbending Branch:</strong> A word picture associated with it is a <strong>stiff, dry branch</strong> that refuses to bend in the wind and eventually snaps. It lacks the "flexibility" of grace and humility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Solo Navigator:</strong> It evokes the image of a <strong>captain who throws away the charts</strong> and ignores the lighthouse, insisting on steering the ship solely by his own "gut feeling."┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
Self-will is the very essence of sin; it is the "I will" of Lucifer (Isaiah 14:13). A leader in the church must be "God-willed," not "self-willed." If a man is <em>authad─ôs</em>, he cannot be a "steward" (v. 7) because a stewardΓÇÖs only job is to carry out the <strong>MasterΓÇÖs will</strong>. A self-willed man eventually turns the church into a monument to himself rather than a temple for God. BibleRef┬á</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:7</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"...as a steward of God, not <strong>self-willed</strong> (authad─ôs)..."</em> Paul is warning Titus against the "Cretan temper." In a culture of "beasts" (v. 12), everyone was "self-pleasing." An elder must be the opposite: a man of <strong>meekness and submission</strong>. If he is self-willed, he will be "quick-tempered" (the next vice) whenever his "self" is challenged. <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>Enduring Word</u></a>┬á</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>2 Peter 2:10:</strong> "...They are presumptuous, <strong>self-willed</strong> (<em>authad─ôs</em>). They are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries." NKJV</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Genesis 49:6 (LXX):</strong> Used to describe Simeon and Levi, who in their <strong>self-will</strong> "digged down a wall" and "slew a man."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 21:24 (LXX):</strong> Used for the "proud and haughty man" who acts in "proud wrath."┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a direct conflict between <em>authad─ôs</em> and <strong>hospitality</strong> (v. 8). A self-willed man cannot be hospitable because hospitality requires "opening oneΓÇÖs life" to others. The <em>authad─ôs</em> man only has room for his own "self." Paul demands a leader who has died to "self" so that Christ can live and lead through him. Precept Austin┬á</p>
