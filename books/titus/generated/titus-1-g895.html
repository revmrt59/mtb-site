<p><strong>CANNOT LIE / WHO NEVER LIES</strong> ΓÇö (<em>apseud─ôs</em>, StrongΓÇÖs G895)<br />
Refers to the absolute, unshakeable veracity of GodΓÇÖs nature. It is a unique and potent attribute that identifies God as being completely "free from falsehood," making it impossible for Him to act or speak in a way that contradicts the Truth. <a href="https://jcgm.org/bible-verse/titus-1-2/"><u>1.1.1</u></a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/893.htm"><u>1.2.1</u></a>┬á</p>

<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
A compound word from <em>a</em> (negative/not) + <em>pseud─ôs</em> (lying, false). It literally means "without falsehood" or "truthful." 1.1.1, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lexicon/titus/1-2.htm"><u>1.2.5</u></a>┬á</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Veracious, truthful, or "incapable of lying." In the New Testament, this specific word occurs only here in Titus 1:2. It is an "ontological" attributeΓÇömeaning God does not just <em>decide</em> to tell the truth; He <strong>is</strong> Truth, making deceit a physical and spiritual impossibility for Him. 1.1.1, 1.2.1┬á</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Infallible Witness:</strong> In Greek mythology, <em>Apseudes</em> was the name of a <strong>Nereid (sea nymph)</strong> who inherited the quality of "never lying" from her father, the "Old Man of the Sea." This highlights the ancient association of the word with a divine, inherited quality of absolute honesty. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apseudes_(mythology)"><u>1.3.1</u></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Pure Gold:</strong> A word picture often associated with <em>apseudes</em> is <strong>unalloyed gold</strong>. Just as pure gold contains no base metals (like lead or copper) that would make it "false" gold, GodΓÇÖs character contains no "trace elements" of deception. 1.2.1</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Contrast with Crete:</strong> Paul used this word as a direct "slap" against the Cretan culture. The Greeks even had a verb, <em>cretize</em>, which meant <strong>"to lie"</strong>. By calling God <em>apseud─ôs</em>, Paul was showing the Cretans a God who was the exact opposite of their own "liar" reputation (v. 12). <a href="https://www.preceptaustin.org/titus_112-13"><u>1.4.6</u></a>┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
GodΓÇÖs trustworthiness is the foundation of all faith. If God could lie about even one small thing, the entire structure of salvation would collapse into uncertainty. <a href="https://www.spurgeon.org/resource-library/sermons/what-god-cannot-do/"><u>1.4.3</u></a> Because He is "without falsehood," His <strong>decree</strong> of eternal life is as certain as His own existence. Faith is simply the act of taking the God-who-cannot-lie at His Word. 1.1.1, <a href="https://versebyversecommentary.com/2015/01/04/titus-12c/"><u>1.4.5</u></a>┬á</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:2</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"...which God, who <strong>cannot lie</strong> (apseud─ôs), promised before time began."</em> Paul is the "Guarantor" of the promise. He knows that Titus is working in a land of "habitual liars" (v. 12). By introducing the "Non-Lying God" early in the letter, Paul provides a <strong>spiritual anchor</strong> for the Cretan believers. Their hope isn't based on a human contract, but on a divine nature that is immune to deception. 1.1.1, 1.4.6┬á</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Note: This specific adjective is only used in Titus 1:2. However, the same theological concept is found elsewhere:</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hebrews 6:18:</strong> "...it is <strong>impossible for God to lie</strong> (<em>pseud┼ì</em>ΓÇöverb form), we might have strong consolation..." 1.4.6</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Numbers 23:19:</strong> "God is not a man, that He should <strong>lie</strong> (<em>ps─ôudos</em>ΓÇöHebrew equivalent)..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 John 5:10:</strong> "...he who does not believe God has made Him a <strong>liar</strong> (<em>pseust─ôs</em>)..." <a href="http://web.mit.edu/jywang/www/cef/Bible/NIV/NIV_Bible/1JOHN+5.html"><u>1.1.3</u></a>┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
Lying is described in Scripture as the hallmark of the devil, the "father of lies" (John 8:44). 1.4.3 By identifying God as <em>apseud─ôs</em>, Paul is drawing a clear "battle line" between the <strong>Kingdom of Truth</strong> and the <strong>Kingdom of the Deceiver</strong> (whose agents were currently "upsetting households" in Crete). <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/titus-1/"><u>1.2.7</u></a>┬á</p>
