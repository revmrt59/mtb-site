<p><strong>1. Greek Roots / Derivation</strong><br />
Derived from <em>bdelyssomai</em> (to feel a nausea or loathing for food). It comes from the root <em>bde┼ì</em>, which means "to stink." Bible Hub┬á</p>
<p><strong>2. Meaning / Lexical Definition</strong><br />
Abominable, detestable, or polluted. It refers to that which is "ritually and morally foul." In the New Testament, it is the highest degree of "uncleanness," describing things that are fundamentally incompatible with a holy God. ThayerΓÇÖs Greek Lexicon┬á</p>
<p><strong>3. Usage in Greek Culture &amp; Word Pictures</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Foul Odor:</strong> In secular Greek, the root was used for <strong>the stench of a decaying corpse</strong> or a stagnant sewer. The word picture is of something so physically repulsive that it causes a person to gag or "turn their nose up."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The IdolΓÇÖs Filth:</strong> In the Septuagint (the Greek OT), this word was frequently used for <strong>pagan idols</strong>. Idols were called "abominations" because they were "stench-gods" that polluted the land and the people. Precept Austin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Contaminated Food:</strong> It evokes the image of a <strong>beautiful dish of food that is actually rotten</strong> on the inside. While the false teachers "professed" to be "pure" (v. 15), Paul says their inner reality was "nauseating" to God.┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Theological Implications</strong><br />
GodΓÇÖs reaction to sin is not just "disapproval"; it is <strong>holy revulsion</strong>. <em>Bdelyktos</em> is the opposite of a "sweet-smelling savor" (Eph 5:2). When religious people use "God-talk" to cover up "beastly" behavior (v. 12) and "dishonest gain" (v. 11), it is an "abomination" because it treats the holiness of God as a cheap tool for personal profit.┬á</p>
<p><strong>5. Contextual Nuance in Titus 1:16</strong><br />
The NKJV says: <em>"being <strong>abominable</strong> (bdelyktos), disobedient, and disqualified..."</em> This is PaulΓÇÖs final verdict on the "circumcision group." They obsessed over "defilement" (v. 15) from foods, but Paul says <strong>they themselves</strong> are the "defiled" thing. They are "abominable" because they are religious on the outside but "foul" on the inside. BibleRef┬á</p>
<p><strong>6. Key Uses in Other Verses (NKJV)</strong>┬á</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Luke 16:15:</strong> "...For what is highly esteemed among men is an <strong>abomination</strong> (<em>bdelygma</em>ΓÇöthe noun form) in the sight of God."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Matthew 24:15:</strong> "Therefore when you see the '<strong>abomination</strong> (<em>bdelygma</em>) of desolation,' spoken of by Daniel..."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Revelation 21:27:</strong> "But there shall by no means enter it anything that defiles, or causes an <strong>abomination</strong> (<em>bdelygma</em>)..."┬á</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Other Relevant Insights</strong><br />
There is a powerful irony in PaulΓÇÖs choice of words. The legalists likely used the word "abominable" to describe the Gentiles who didn't keep the Law. Paul "turns the table" on them, declaring that the <strong>legalist who denies God with his works</strong> is the one who is truly "abominable" in the eyes of Heaven. Bible Hub┬á</p>
